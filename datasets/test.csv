i m in a sexless marriage and have feeling for a married man in a sexless marriage tl dr i m 28f been with my 32m husband five year am having romantic feeling for a friend 34m i ve known online for a year my friend and his wife have been together 17 year married for 8 am i crossing the line by being so open to him about intimate thing i feel invisible to my husband i m a 28f and my husband 32m rarely ha sex with me we have a pretty superficial relationship and i m living in his home country 6000 mile away from mine it get lonely and isolating we have a toddler child i love more than anything in the world divorce is something that cross my mind but it would be a clusterfuck with international custody law and i m afraid his family would disown my child in the event of a divorce a divorce carry a social stigma where i live i have a friend i met online 34m who ha become quite close he ha a wife and three kid and he love them immensely but his marriage ha been sexless for over a year and he s been hurt by that we ve bonded a lot through message and being in some online group together lately we ve shared a lot about sexual preference and how it hurt that our partner are sexually mismatched for example my husband hasn t given me oral sex for the entirety of our marriage and it hurt me my friend ha told me about how much it mean to him to be able to give oral sex to his wife but she started thinking it s sinful so she shut it down we ve bonded a lot but i m afraid that i m starting to get feeling for him since we re sharing so much that being said it s important for both of u to be able to talk about these topic since our spouse won t hear it he and i joke a lot but he s made some comment about how in another life we should have been together or that i m a snack he d eat for dinner if he could we joke a lot so i don t want to read into it too much but since i m so sexually neglected by my husband hearing even an offhand comment like that stir up a lot in me this friend and his wife have also been generous a few time when i wa separated from my husband and staying in my home country in sending me a bit of financial support this all happened before he opened up to me about the sexless aspect of his marriage anyway i am visiting my home country in a few month and i need to fly into the city where my friend and his wife live they are going to host my son and me for a few day anyway i want to preserve my friendship with him and i don t want to compromise his wife s or my husband s trust i just need to process this somewhere i am trying to not condemn my feeling but to not make choice based on them i hope it s a crush that will dissipate and thhe friendship will remain strong do i need to lay down better boundary,0
emotional abuse am i imagining it practicality in leaving i am in my mid 20 f with a an older partner 13 year older of the same sex i have been in an abusive relationship before where thing were more obvious and more explosive my ex tried to stab me when i left and used to punch wall if i tried to see my friend and blame me for her behaviour my next relationship wa with an older woman i met who i am still with after more than 6 year however thing aren t the best the first couple of year were amazing and i had never been happier i felt free i felt like i wa truly in love then came the first few sign she started pulling away from me we weren t really sleeping together that much anymore and i blamed myself for it maybe i wa too needy too much if i tried to talk to her about it to find out if something wa wrong she would get angry and tell me to leave if it bothered me and that i wa a sex addict and expected too much i wa happy with once every few week but i thought maybe i wa a sex addict so i left it to stop her getting upset annoyed at me she wa suffering from anxiety and so i just tried to support her a much a i could and understood how to she then started accusing me of having sex with my friend or that i wa going to this included people i had known for many year and only ever saw a friend this would make me feel guilty and i thought maybe i wa being disrespectful by seeing my friend she ha specifically said this a i wa going to stay at a platonic friend s straight female i have been friend with for over 10 year house before she moved to a different country in an entirely different room after a night out however she told me this wa unacceptable and disrespectful and that i should either sleep in my car or come home it wa the middle of the winter and it get cold where i live so i didn t go and my friend ha now cut contact with me after getting annoyed that i wa too worried to see her this ha happened multiple time but fortunately my other friend haven t cut contact she ha been accusing me of sleeping with other people for about 4 year now and it is taking it toll on me she ha also started to ask me why i need to straighten my hair to go to work or why i am wearing what i am when i go out i have lost count of the number of time i have cancelled plan because she get upset before i am due to go or she make a fuss about it i admit that our relationship didn t start on the best term my abusive ex told my current partner i slept with her even though i physically couldn t have because i wa with my partner at the time she said it happened she ha told me she will never trust me and i have to either accept it or leave i guess i thought i could show her that she can trust me but now i feel like i m a doormat i m scared to go home because i feel like i will get shouted at if i have forgotten to do certain chore told that i do nothing her son also say this to me even though i do my best and actually have no time for myself a when i m not working i m cleaning the house when i have tried to leave in the past she get upset immediately and behaves like she did at the start of our relationship for a couple of week then fall back into her old way i feel like i m asking for permission to go out and if she were to disapprove even if she s not at home and i go out she kick off massively her son tell her and also tell her if i have been on the phone to people i have told her that our behaviour are not healthy for one another my people pleasing necessity because i m insecure and her anxiety about me going place to see friend i am seeking therapy for mine and she said she would but now insists she is fine and that i am the one with all of the problem that it is unhealthy to trust your partner i am not at home at the moment a i am working away and i am trying to build myself up from feeling like nothing i don t want to go home and be scared anymore but part of me wonder if i m imagining it because of my ex s behaviour and maybe that this is normal and i m in the wrong for wanting to meet up with friend another thing she say is that she can t make anyone feel a certain way only their perception of what is said can make someone feel a certain way i e bad any opinion are appreciated i am very much at the end of my tether but i don t want to leave our house and life together if it is just me being insecure and i just need to support my partner more it s hard to believe that someone i have loved so much would turn like this and so i second guess myself a lot thank you,1

from school some day because she wa too hungover or she wa out drinking i ve been in the car with both my mom and dad a they swerved on the road from how drunk they were i had to stop my parent from hurting each other my dad swore he wa going to beat my mom or kill her my mom and dad both cheated on each other which lead to more alcohol abuse my older sister wa never there for me a i believe she also suffers from some sort of mental illness my older sister wa the first to show me how to cut myself and where to cut myself to hide it when my mom found out i wa cutting i told her my sister taught me and she didnt believe me my parent have always loved my sister way more than me always telling me how i should be more like her and how she s better than me they ve always loved my little sister more a well my little sister experienced a lot of trauma early on a well both mental and physical she wa always being hit by my mom my little sister and i have a stronger bond than my older sister and i so anyways i broke up with my abusive ex when i wa 14 in 2011 and began to talk more and more to my current husband we ended up meeting up at a park with a couple of friend he wa so cute his eye were what caught my attention his hazel green eye his dark hair his brown skin and his perfect white smile the first day we met we hugged and held each other i had scar on my wrist and he asked me what happened so i told him he kissed them and told me he would always be there for me the next day we met up again and this time we finally kissed he wa so shy and i found it so cute how shy he wa he wasnt the most attractive guy out there he wa nerdy and a little geeky he wa shy and didn t like to look you in the eye i found that very cute that day we decided we would start dating everything went well for the summer we ended up losing our virginity to each other a month into our relationship we talked a lot almost everyday and saw each other a lot i would go to his house a lot because his mom or dad didnt like to drive him to mine and my dad didnt mind it all changed when we started high school that fall he wouldn t talk to me for week even if i called him or texted him a million time he would only talk to me when i d say if we are going to date you will have to talk to me or we will need to break up or if i said we need to talk or i think we need to break up then he would talk to me for maybe a week and go right back to ignoring me for month this wa a cycle we would see each other maybe once a month on sunday but when we did all he wanted wa sex and then he would do his own thing like play video game or watch youtube video i would get really upset a it seemed all he wanted me for wa sex then came march 2012 he called me one night while i wa having dinner with my family i had just seen him the day before and i thought we were good except for the fact that we only had sex and he went to walk around the neighborhood and left me and his friend at his house so anyways he call me and tell me that his mom said we cant be together i asked him why and he gave me some b excuse about how it wa because his friend the one he left me with at his house liked me and wanted to kill himself because i wouldn t date him i got really really upset at the time i wa already struggling with depression and had been hospitalized once in august 2011 after i odd on different medication after he had told me how he wanted to have a threesome with my 2 bestfriends so this time when he told me we were over i cried and cried and felt soooooooo low my mom let me sleep with her that night a she wa afraid i d try to kill myself again i wa on spring break at the time which meant i d be home all day while my parent and sister worked the following night i took 50 tylenol and 6 seroquel pill that i had been collecting for month i swallowed them 5 at a time and went to sleep i called my husband and told him i had taken the pill and that i wa going to hopefully die he laughed and his friend took his phone only to tell me great see you in hell and hung up i ended up sleeping from 9am to 5pm the next day only because my mom woke me up and wanted to check on me before she left for work i told her i wa ok and that she can leave peacefully i wa disappointed i hadn t died i then began to vomit a lot and my sister kept asking me if i took something i told her no i m just sick she had her suspicion a i had a history of overdosing already finally at around 8pm i began to throw up a lot of blood i finally cried out to her and told her what i had done my parent hurried home from work and drove me to the hospital my sister called my husband to tell him what had happened and she told me he just laughed and hung up i wa devastated i spent 1 week in the icu waiting for a liver transplant because i fucked it up so bad the doctor were afraid i wa going to die without one we couldn t find a donor a week into my stay my liver began to scar over and repair itself i wa sent to the psychiatric unit for another week after the icu when i got out my parent refused to let me talk to my husband they took my phone and the mouse to the computer i still had my ps3 and figured out how to get on facebook through it i began talking to my husband again i wanted him back i missed him i loved him long story short we got back together after about 3 month after my suicide attempt my parent were not happy and did not want him to come over or take me over so i d take the bus i took the bus to see him in any type of weather he wa living in a different house by then because his parent had divorced i loved him but i hated him he started to do the same shit all over again only talking to me when he wanted and only wanted me for sex he would get mad if i didn t give him sex i broke up with him over this for about 6 month and had a new boyfriend but i ended my relationship with my new boyfriend and went back to my husband this is where my memory get a little blurry so i m going to skip a lot after about 2 year into our relationship he finally felt like a boyfriend he would invite me over to his house a lot his family always wanted me over and we would go on date we were junior in high school by then and it all felt so perfect finally i wa so in love with him we would talk about the future but he always told me he didn t want to ever get married and he never wanted kid due to his trauma with his family i respected that and never pressured him into it one day we had an argument after i read a message on his phone from his so called bestfriend asking him why he had touched her breast kissed her and called her his i wa furious i wanted to leave but he stopped me he cornered me in a corner in his basement the basement wa his living area and room and i tried to push him away but when i lifted my arm he grabbed me by the neck and choked me and said i ll fucking kill you bitch i wa scared i wa terrified i kicked him off and ran upstairs begging his mom to help me she told me to get the fuck out and never come again she took his side i a dumbass forgave him and stayed with him his mom didnt like me at this point anymore because i had started smoking weed and i wa a bad influence to her son i wasnt allowed to go over to his house for month after this he had to come to my house from then on and would sneak me in his house at time after a while his mom finally said it wa ok for me to come over again one day i wa experimenting with cough syrup nightquil and started tripping hard i wa having intense paranoia and delusion and i went to my husband house asking him where the hell he wa hiding girl he looked at me crazy but he showed me around and proved there wa no one there he offered me hot chocolate to calm me down but i wa so out of it that i swore he wa trying to poison me his mom came home and tried to calm me down she thought i wa just having a mental breakdown she gave me tea and told me i could sleepover that night so i did my husband wa supportive and understanding he didnt know i wa high he thought i just had a breakdown a well the next morning everything wa fine and we didnt talk about what had happened i went home that evening and everything wa good during our senior year of high school i got heavy into drug i wa using weed lsd cocaine and experimenting with different synthetic drug and different pill after we graduated high school i started working both my husband and i worked but at different job he wa going to college a well i would get off work at 10 pm and usually got home at 11 30 pm i remember telling my husband that i wa going to bed when in reality i wa meeting up with different men off the internet that i had never even met buying drug from them or trading sex for drug i wa using a lot of lsd and i had sex with over 10 different men my husband had absolutely no idea what wa going on april of 2017 he recommended we move in together and i kind of feared it because that meant i couldn t do my drug in secrecy anymore that april i had a month long affair with a guy that wa on a felony warrant for domestic violence but i didnt care i only wanted the drug and sex that same month my husband took me to puerto rico for our anniversary it wa amazing after we came back i ended my affair with that guy and never heard from him again my husband and i moved into our first apartment that july i felt in love and at peace with him we were both working always had date night on saturday and went on a lot of vacation i wa still using drug and cheating at the time i didn t care i even cheated on him while he wa at work in our own bed i did many thing i regret thing i hate myself for i still hate myself for that to this day in the year of 2018 i found out my husband had been messaging other girl and sending nude claiming he wa single and lived alone i wa so sad i went into a deep depression and started to use drug every single day i even began to drink something i swore i d never do after seeing my parent be alcoholic i tried to leave my husband right there and then but i had all this guilt from what i had done that he had no idea i had done my cheating slowed down a whole lot but i still cheated when a guy gave me attention i let this go and he swore he would stop he even let me go thru his phone i didnt find anything and trusted him more but my trust wa still broken i still felt like he wa hiding something but i couldn t tell what we ended up moving to our second apartment july 2018 and he swore it would be a fresh start i still didnt trust him tho i felt like something just wasnt right at this point i had stopped all the drug use except for weed and alcohol and a one time trip on lsd that resulted in a bad trip i had also stopped the cheating but continued to see a guy i met online just to smoke and talk we never did anything besides smoke and talk a he wa very respectful about my relationship anyways that same year i began to be more and more paranoid while caused u to fight a lot i told him that i knew he wa still hiding shit and he would deny it and say i wa just being delusional and that i needed help so one day i decided maybe he right and went to a crisis center to get evaluated the told me nothing wa wrong and it wa normal for me to feel what i felt after what he did i went back home and continued to live with him by this point i started to play detective i found out a way to view his web app call message and phone activity by logging onto his google account what i found turned my stomach he had still been talking girl but wa installing and uninstalling the app he would send nude via email and had another email account through yahoo he even went a far a messaging an escort on craigslist and asking her for her price he even messaged a guy on accident and when the guy told him he wa a guy my husband said lol it s ok i might be into it this had been going on since the day he swore he had stopped he had continued for the whole year while calling me crazy and delusional that day that i went to the crisis center he wa on the app messaging those girl sending nude sending video and asking for sex i felt so betrayed i wa so depressed i wanted to leave but still felt a lot of guilt for what i had done behind his back i stayed with him after confronting him he swore he would stop and that 2019 would be our year december 2018 came along and i wa so depressed that i overdosed on 80 gabapentin and wa hospitalized they kept me in the psychiatric unit again he came to visit often and talked with me on the phone every day i stayed there for only a week and wa diagnosed with ptsd and borderline personality disorder along with social anxiety generalized anxiety and of course depression he wa supportive for a while i wa on different medication and they had many side effect which he would help me through he wa always there for me to cry on he held me he kissed me he wa always there but then it all changed we began to fight a lot and i had more and more mental breakdown the weed and alcohol weren t helping my situation at all he begged me to stop the drug and drinking which i d lie and say i did but i d do them at work i m pretty sure he knew i wa still using but didnt bring it up to avoid fighting in february 2019 we had another fight i dont remember about what and i ended up taking 20 tylenol with 6 99proof shooter i wa out of it he called the paramedic and they took me to the hospital he spent all night and skipped work the next morning to be with me i blacked out so i don t remember anything except when i woke up the next morning they let me go home after they had me drink charcoal again my husband wa so supportive loving and caring he took care of me and every time before that if i cut myself he would clean my wound and bandage them up i still felt a lot of anger and depression tho and constantly brought up what he had done i began to suspect that he wa cheating on me at work and would pick fight with him despite all my fighting with him he proposed to me in march of 2018 and i said yes by the end of march i noticed i hadnt had my period in a month and took a pregnancy test it came back positive we were both sooo happy and excited it wa perfect but i wa still feeling depressed and betrayed and found it hard to trust him we got married april 2018 and had a good time we were fighting a lot by then and i wa constantly suspicious of him i accused him of cheating a lot went through his phone every single day accused him of having a second phone and even having camera in our apartment i felt crazy i needed help but i felt too gone to be helped i believe he got tired of it one morning i wa going through his phone and he slept and i found something from year ago and woke him up asking him a bunch of question he tried to ignore me and went to the bathroom i felt like he wa in there too long and accused him of being on his second phone that he wa hiding in the bathroom he got tired of listening to me bitch at him and he told me fine next time i go take a piss you can hold my hand i got mad and started yelling he then climbed on top of me and tried to push and shove me and tried to pick me off the bed while i wa 5 week pregnant i told him to please get off before he hurt the baby and he told me fuckyou he then told me to call the cop and so i did he punched himself in the face and said he would tell the police i did that to him i wa furious the police showed up and we gave our side of the story he wa arrested and put on a no contact order i wa depressed and paranoid the whole time he wa away we didnt talk for week until one night while i wa out smoking with my friend while pregnant i got a call from a restricted number i answered and it wa my husband telling me he miss me and he love me and miss his baby and that he want to be better for me i wa so high and couldnt really talk normally so i told him i loved him and that thing would be ok and that i would get him out of this mess i told him i had to hang up because the fed could ve been listening and went back to smoking the following month we weren t supposed to talk or see each other or he would go to jail and lose his bond he took many risk for me and still came to see me in the same apartment he got arrested at he still called me every night to tell me he loved me and missed me i wa still paranoid and suspicious and accused him of cheating while he wa away he told me he never wanted to be away to begin with and it wa all my fault he wa away he swore he wasnt cheating even tho i cheated on him a week after he got arrested he started to deny his baby and said i probably cheated when i conceived which i hadnt i knew this baby wa his he finally accepted this baby our no contact order lasted for 3 month because his court date kept changing and i couldnt get my side of the story finally in june of 2019 i went to his court date with all my mental health record and told them he hadnt been violent and that i had just had a mental breakdown after a long day they dropped the case and he wa allowed to come back home he wasnt the same after this he wa angry with me all the time after he came back we left on a vacation to minnesota and when we came back we moved into a new apartment that is closer to where our baby will be born the whole time we were distant from each other we always fought he always told me he wa tired of me and that he didn t want me or our son in his life i felt guilty and told him i would kill myself once our son is born so he can be happy without me he said he didnt want our son because he would remind him of me i felt so sad when he said that he didnt want our son because of me it wa all my fault despite not having any evidence of him cheating i still felt like he wa he doesnt shower or change his clothes in fear that i ll accuse him of cheating which i have he s scared of me he s scared of me calling the cop over anything a i have done 3 time now he easily angered now and easily annoyed with me he doesnt like to be around me anymore and i feel distant from him he ha crohn disease which make him very irritable and depressed and he say he want to die i try to comfort him but my negative thought always get in the way i always end up fighting with him i ask him to help my clean but he always in pain due to his disease and he get angry that i ask him he yell at me and tell me i m annoying and he tell me he tired of me he ha kicked me out and i stayed at my mom house but came back the next night and he welcomed me with open arm he suffers a lot mentally and physically and i feel i contribute to his pain there are day when i think i m better off dead because of how much i have damaged him i feel at fault for everything in our relationship i want our son to have both of his parent but i feel like my bpd take over me and i become a very paranoid person my husband is obviously tired of this i dont blame him i m pretty sick and tired of myself a well i truly feel he would be better off if i died i feel helpless and hopeless i feel like i ll never get better i m abusive and i always blamed him of being abusive when he wa nothing but loving even if he made mistake i love my husband i think he deserves better but i dont know if i ll ever be better i m scared of myself i don t know what will set me off i feel depressed alone i hate myself i just want to show my husband the love he deserves but my bpd get in the way every fucking time why cant i just be normal,1
how can i tell who wa really the abusive one in my relationship i believe that my ex wa abusing me but during the relationship she wa the one accusing me of abuse and she had me completely convinced that i really wa abusive and i wa basically wrapped around her finger for the rest of the relationship trying to jump through all these hoop to make it up to her and prove my worth etc she wa never satisfied though and would seemingly have mood swing where she d just sling verbal abuse at me and if i objected she basically refused to be held accountable because you deserve it i don t care if it hurt you i want to hurt you all you care about is your own feeling stop talking to me if you don t like it and so on i basically accepted that protesting got me nowhere and just made me look selfish in her eye so i pretty much just shut up and accepted her narrative the thing is i can t tell if she wa actually right about me being abusive or if she just got into my head and brainwashed me i feel like i can bring up dozen of example of her emotionally or verbally abusing me but the time i supposedly abused her were basically due to me being in a state of nervous breakdown from her emotionally abusing me and threatening to cheat on me other than that i would say i wa pretty emotionally unavailable at time but this isn t abuse like she acted like it wa and i think me being emotionally unavailable wa because she made our relationship codependent extremely early on and i wa instinctively pulling back i think what i can be sure of is that we were both trying to force ourselves to be compatible when we weren t so it s a good lesson for me and anyone reading who wa in a similar situation don t try to make something work that doesn t want to work anyways how can i tell if it wa me being abusive or her i m worried that i m subconsciously biased because obviously i don t want to be the bad person so maybe i m overlooking stuff i did that wa bad but i deleted all our text so i can t look back and remind myself of stuff i might have forgotten idk thanks for reading future advice guy,1
how do i 30f confront my wife 29f about my suspicion of infidelity without sounding paranoid or nosy long story coming up sorry i ve been with my wife for 7 year and married for five we ve always had a great relationship everything ha always been really open and honest we have a good sex life and we hardly fight for the past two month there ha been an odd situation going on and i m not sure how to approach it without coming off a paranoid or upsetting her basically a few month ago i woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of her typing away at her laptop the desk is at the foot of our bed i remember groggily waking up in asking if she needed anything and she assured me that she wa just having trouble sleeping and wa firing off some email to take her mind off thing i said fair enough and went back to sleep the second time it happened wa a few day later i woke up at around 4 a m after listening to her typing for a few minute and asked if she needed a tea or if she needed me to rub her belly or something to help her sleep rubbing her belly always help her go to sleep if she s on her period and it wa that time of the month in case anyone is wondering about that haha she said no and that she wa okay and just not having a very sleepy night and that she would come to bed when she wa tired again i just went to sleep the third time this happened i wa hearing her typing and i laid awake listening to it for almost 45 minute before i sat up in bed and asked her if i could get her anything and if she wa sure she wa okay she responded like she didn t realize that i wa awake and quickly closed the laptop she said that she wa fine and came back to bed quickly falling asleep i had been mentioning throughout the day that maybe she should talk to her doctor about her lack of sleep and she said that she wa okay just having a bit of a rough time with it for the most part everything wa totally normal a few night i have woken up to her in the middle of the night under the cover on her phone i m not normally a snoopy person and i definitely trust her and honestly sometimes she doe watch youtube video or scroll instagram on her phone in the middle of the night if she can t sleep so i really didn t pay much mind to it i also want to add that i have a very strong prescription and without my glass i can t even see what s on my own phone screen clearly let alone would i be able to see what s on her screen from across the bed and then one night i rolled over and put my arm around her waist and leaned my head up by her ear to give her a kiss and tell her she should try going to sleep she quickly shut her phone screen off and responded a little bit flustered and said that she wasn t tired she sharply told me not to read over her shoulder incase i see something in a work email that i shouldn t she ha multiple ndas because of her job she got up and left the room after that opting to sleep on the couch because she said she wa too hot in the room and didn t want to keep me up any longer the next morning i asked her if she wa sure everything wa okay again because i just don t want her to be unhappy or get chronically fatigued or anyting a few more instance like this but everything during the day are normal our sex life is normal and for most of the night honestly her sleep is normal but then about 2 week ago i turn over in the middle of the night because i m having a hard time sleeping now and the brightness from her laptop radiating off of the white wall in our room and the clacking of the key is keeping me up i sit up in bed and tell her that the laptop is keeping me awake and ask her if there s anything i can do to help her sleep she say no quite sharply and get up to leave the room again grabbing her laptop in a super big flurry this time i reach over and flip the lamp on before she leaf the room i noticed that she isn t wearing pyjama on her lower half and her shirt is unbuttoned she look to be sweaty and her face and neck are totally flushed it s pretty much the kind of look that she only ha when she s either super sick working out or we are intimate with each other i m a little bit surprised and we are just silent for a moment i can tell that she know that i know something is up she say that she feel physically sick and ha been having a bit of a fever and that s why she look sweaty and assures me that it s okay i give her a weird look and i start tearing up because all the thought about why she is sweaty and secretive in the middle of the night are running through my mind i do something i ve never done before and ask her if i can look at the laptop i told her that her behaviour seems really strange to me she look really flushed and she s breathing a little bit heavy and i know it might come off a paranoid but i love her and i know she love me and it would help my trust a lot if i could just look at what she wa doing she blew up at me and said that i wa being paranoid and that she would never cheat on me she went to stay at her mom s house for the night and the following night and came back two day later and apologized she assured me she wasn t cheating and that she just wasn t feeling well that night lately though thing have been just off she seems disconnected there wa one day that the nerve got the better of me and i decided to check her phone she had change the passcode i realize that she

evidence and honestly no real suspicion that our marriage is on the rock or that she would start cheating on me anyway tl dr i have woken up multiple time to my wife on her laptop or phone in the middle of the night and she always seems flustered and secretive when i ask her what she s doing we have an otherwise amazing marriage i have no actual evidence that she would be cheating on me how do i bring this up without sounding paranoid,0
gf 24f of 1 year refuse to stay with me 28m at my parent house while meeting them for the first time due to them wanting u to sleep in separate bed my gf and i met while travelling over a year ago and we come from different country we are planning over the new year to visit both her family and then travel internationally to visit my family i ve been super pumped about introducing her to my family showing her my family home and the town i grew up in when i spoke to my mum on the phone about the idea she wa thrilled but also reminded me about the rule of them wanting u to sleep in separate bed whilst unmarried for me this isn t such a big deal i grew up super religious with them and already know how it all work and they re actually super chill with everything else they don t make comment about my relationship or life that are influenced by their religion when i told my gf i could see she wa frustrated by the idea she said whatever and didn t mention it for a few day just now she s mentioned to me that it s been bothering her a lot so much that she refuse to stay there if we have to abide by rule like that normally i d figure out a plan b here to accomodate her concern but there isn t a practical one i can think of and it s putting a damper on the idea of going to see my parent this way at all we can t stay with friend a they ve all moved away there s no hotel nearby and even if we stayed in one we don t have a car to get around i m not keen on flying all the way home just to stay in a hotel down the road and not even be able to see my family because i don t have a way to get there at this point i told her there no point in visiting my family if we can t stay there and she said it fine and maybe we could arrange to meet somewhere in between for me it just seems ridiculous i thought she would be willing to make a sacrifice like that because obviously it would mean a lot to me it s not just visiting my family i really want to show her the house i grew up in and the town a well am i missing something here it really hurt tl dr basically the title girlfriend doesn t seem interested in meeting my family for the first time under one of their house rule and can t seem to see how much that hurt me,0

my entire abuse story long tldr i m a victim of very serious gaslighting and every day is torture my mother and five other sibling all contribute and enable each other in my abuse i want out but i m terrified i won t be able to manage out on my own when i wa no more than five or six it started with a diagnosis i remember being taken to a place called the mind institute where i wa put in an mri machine and scanned a well a some other test to learn about my brain activity at the time the doctor were investigating the potential for me to have epilepsy what they found wa very different it s called attention deficit hyperactivity disorder the doctor explained that it s why i couldn t focus in school and my mind seemed to wander so much from learning activity i can still recall the sound of their voice speaking in a hushed tone the way people do when they re talking about you but in a way they know you wouldn t like to hear in order to get me to pay attention and sit still for the mri they convinced me if i behaved i d receive a plush monkey i just wanted the monkey i didn t care at the time to understand what any of this meant not long after i started taking a stimulant medication named ritaline my school performance improved dramatically but at a very serious cost using stimulant on people with this mental disorder ha a few set back i wa a skinny kid but the pill made me skinnier a lot skinnier stimulant are also like a mega dose of caffeine and the way my young brain reacted to that caused me to be constantly in an intense rush my brain wa racing so fast my little body couldn t keep up i wa twitchy and acted a you d expect from a six year old being basically loaded on a chemical not very different from meth or cocaine i became anxious and hyper constantly picking at my skin and chewing my nail even pulling my eyelash out anything to relieve the built up energy and resulting anxiety my mother didn t care she wanted the good grade she got them i m not saying it wasn t great or it didn t save me from a lot of struggling in my future but imagine being a parent so neglectful you d do this to them before ever trying to intervene and offer help it s not that i don t have adhd it s that medicine isn t a magic cure on it s own rewriting my brain and making me normal this wa only the beginning though of a very very abusive and cruel pattern the med made me look like a skeleton and act like a total freak always picking at myself and unable to even talk to people i immediately started to get bullied my mother never noticed this or cared she wa a doctor after all and this wa the beginning of her obsession with trying solve all her family s problem with pill i m not sure why she never tried to connect with u communicate with u or raise u like a normal parent i wa never taught any life skill or given any guidance just criticism anger and more pill when i wa 10 my mother and my father entered a phase of furious screaming and fighting that wouldn t end until my father passed away when i wa twelve the screaming at home made my anxious behavior even worse at the same time they were in a heated divorce and custody case with each other that even a they separated could never be settled don t listen to anything your dad say he s crazy she d tell me maybe he wa maybe he wasn t i can t tell you i barely remember him because he worked so much and after the separation i almost never saw him he definitely wa strange but my mother which i didn t realize at the time will lie any way she wish to manipulate me and others when mom wa home she d watch me eat my dinner and sneer at me in disgust commenting on my weight why are you so thin you re sick in the head you do it because you love being skinny this is the first time i heard her say something about me to me that seemed so gravely untrue i didn t eat because between the bullying at school the nightmare of a home life i lived and the pill i didn t have an appetite but she wa convinced i wa anorexic and obsessed with being skinny that a prepubescent child like me would starve myself to feel pretty when i wa little i didn t really even have a concept of what i looked like or if i felt beautiful or not even if i wa anorexic i can t picture a crueler way for a parent to react to it she told me i liked it that way and that it s disgusting maybe i wasn t fat but i knew every time i saw my bone jutting out after that day that i hated my body and i blamed myself for it my sibling were a rage filled and violent a the story you hear about abusive drunk my brother would slam me into book shelf and wall and slap me right in the face just for getting in his way he irrationally hated me because i wa uncool in school and that embarrassed him home wa violence school were a hundred face glaring in despise and my one available parent blamed all my suffering on myself i cried always i can t think of a memory in my childhood not filled with sobbing my voice raw and when i cried my mother screamed at me in disgust you re pathetic you re just wallowing and feeling sorry for yourself you just want to be miserable and feel bad and pity yourself shut up she d scream at me of course i wa a child i just cried harder i developed an unhealthy clinging to teacher the only people mature enough to understand the tragedy of my situation i d spend every recess inside not wanting to play with the other kid because they hated me so so much and i cried i ve spent so many hour with my face down against a desk i can still feel it cool damp and somehow comforting i might have had one or two friend when i wa very very young but for the majority of my childhood i had none all of this culminated into a severe lack of social skill i wa hopeless at making friend i once just came up and hugged a girl thinking she d find it nice and want to be my friend the same day the other kid threw putty at me and told me that freak can t make friend especially with the cool kid i never talked to anyone i wa afraid to talk i wa terrified of people and every time i started to talk to people i melted into tear to be absolutely fair my family never interacted with me in any way other than abuse i didn t know how to talk to people i wa practically feral my mother never did anything about my situation to help my brother and sister slept sound to this day many therapist remark the fact that i didn t try to kill myself is an absolute miracle because my environment ensured that i truly had nothing to live for most day when i wa eleven or twelve my mother decided that my brother s violent act against me though she d never done a single thing to stop them were sign of the very dangerous disorder bipolar she explained that people that suffer with this disorder have episode of mania where they become insane and delusional and then wildly violent and impossible to control i don t deny that my brother is an abusive person probably a complete sociopath on every level but for her to describe her own child a psychotic violent and insane to the rest of her child will never be a moral thing to me she knew a an adult that calling one of u outright crazy would cause the rest of me and my sibling to turn on them she did it anyway and of course we did unfortunately it didn t end there a i entered my teen i became more depressed and my mother decided this proved i had bipolar too she only noticed my misery when it again affected my grade whenever i had my energetic spell a part of adhd she d tell me i wa having a manic episode and acting crazy i d absolutely panic and want to scream in fear on the inside i trusted my mother i had no reason to but i did when she said i wa i went into a panic and second guessed myself asking if i wasn t seeing the world for what it wa or if i wa out of touch with reality i switched to a new medication meant to control my mood why wa i having mood because i matured and saw how awful my life wa how everyone treated me and decided i didn t deserve this i stopped letting people push me around and just assuming it had to happen that it wa my fault i turned rebellious and started fighting my sibling who d been so abusive and cruel to me mocked everything i loved and made me miserable day in and day out i decided i wouldn t tolerate that any longer the house turned into a complete battle ground i realized my hate for everyone and all the wrong they d done and my heart finally closed it s wall on them i stopped trying to love them despite it because i thought that s what i wa supposed to do i decided i truly hated them and for so so many good reason mom didn t like that she convinced all my sibling i wa crazy that my fit of highly justified anger were just pure insanity she just love to fight and make people hurt each other wa her excuse she just love making people angry of course this made the bullying at home so so much worse and like always my mother sat and watched me be tormented this time she seemed to enjoy the cruelty she d orchestrated against me but no i wa just crazy every time i cried for being beaten called horrible name i can never repeat i wa just delusional i wa just imagining thing when she had told me a a little child that my skinniness wa because i loved looking thin i wa just crazy right thing got out of control we had fight after fight and she just got nastier and showed more of her true self with each confrontation she beat me when she felt like it she told my friend my relative anyone that would listen that i wa a sick sick insane person she d bring me to the psychiatrist and when the psychiatrist would ask how i felt i d want to cry and tell her how i wa tortured instead my mother would speak for me and tell the doctor i don t know how she ha any friend i don t know how anyone could stand her she s unbearable she s horrible she s completely out of control whenever i brought up any of these incident she d wildly deny them all with claim like i never said that and you re crazy you re just imagining it but i wa crazy right my mom must just be correct right because all my life i d been told to listen to my parent i d never had a word for how she treated me and had never had something to point at to prove this wa abuse i wa so lost in her lie i wasn t sure anymore wa i losing it what wa real anymore she made me question myself constantly and soon i just believed whatever she said took whatever pill she shoved at me i wanted to be loved for once in my life maybe if i wa just a good girl she d finally love me that never happened my social skill had improved since my early youth but i never told my new friend what happened at home i wa terrified still that it wa somehow my fault and i wa terrified to tell anyone the truth because i wasn t sure what wa true worse yet i hated myself i hated the ugliness they brought out in me my family had me convinced that they were all innocent and the fighting i caused wa just me terrorizing them that every time i hit back i wa some sick violent person when it wa more like a dog trapped in a cage being stabbed at with stick and then screamed at when it finally bite i had just learned how to bite after so many year of being jabbed and i just couldn t stop biting i blamed myself i asked myself why can t you just be nice i grew up carrying disgust for my own action despite what i lived through because i wa convinced i wa just sick and torturing myself instead i wa afraid if i ever opened up and seeked someone s help about this story they d focus on the fact that i began to lash back and say i truly wa the tormentor in this hellish life i ve lived thinking about the possibility that it wa all my fault that my family turned into a mess of violence and cruelty made me want to not exist or do anything with my life so i tried to avoid ever finding reality or making sense of it after all the lie i wa afraid to know the truth then one day i found a video that described the term gaslighting at first i thought these psychology video and all the advice i d ever learned from class and beyond would never remedy my history with my family that d it always be this traumatic tangled nightmare i could never make sense of or even want to but this word this single term changed my life you see maybe you ve heard of gaslighting but perhaps you think it s just lying here or there or denying one or two truth gaslighting is when you lie continuously and develop an erratic pattern of abuse where you eventually convince your victim they are crazy you develop a very twisted and intense control over them where they listen to whatever you tell them out of fear that they themselves are too out of touch with reality to know what s happening to them the minute it wa defined to me everything made sense how every horrible hellish thing that happened to me wa supposedly my fault all the pill and the diagnosis that didn t suit me all of it became so crystal clear where it used to be muddy i m not crazy i m not cruel i m a victim of one big never ending manipulation that ha made me confused and afraid to think or act for most of my life suddenly the injustice i always felt and disbelief for the blame set on me made total sense i wasn t insane the word gaslighting itself seemed to grab me by the shoulder and shake and just yell you re not crazy you re not crazy it wa too obvious now the way my mother had purposefully tricked me all these year to be anything else everything seemed to click into place i m not a villain i m not a monster i m not a sick twisted abuser i m not bipolar i m not manic i m not crazy i m a victim reacting to hell the way you would but reacting to hell doe not ever give anyone the right to call you the devil once i knew this i wa never the same my belief in the cruel thing my mother said vanished almost immediately the abuse no longer worked because i didn t let it sink it s hook into my brain just like that i wa immune it still hurt from time to time the thing i wa called but i developed a new sense of calm and decided on a new strategy i gave up on my family that day for good i accepted that it wasn t my fault they were horrible and i didn t have to deal with it i developed a new system of isolation today i still live with them but i hardly ever talk to any of them i hide in my room and i keep to myself incident still happen and sometimes there s no escaping them but when i stopped caring what they thought or what they said i stopped trying to fight them and just deserted them altogether and i can say the suffering is almost over almost this experience ha shaped me always i don t trust easily and even when i do i m quick to remove that trust and once removed it can be so hard to earn it back i have this acute ability to read people detect what kind of person they are and if they re safe to be around unfortunately this also turn to panic and paranoia where i analyze any hurtful thing they ve done with suspicion that they are dangerous or cold hearted like my family i don t justify this it s bad it make it almost impossible for me to experience healthy close relationship because i m so quick to look for the evidence of someone being toxic or abusive i hold grudge eternally and i mean really eternally i struggle with forgiveness so intensely that i will remember a hurtful thing for year and point to it whenever i have any reason to suspect a person re analyzing it and looking for clue of danger these are the effect of the gaslighting but i d be lying if i said i don t feel a beautiful blissful feeling of finally being free of the mental chain that once held me prisoner i will never be gaslit again i know it so well i cannot be tricked i m so afraid of being tricked though that everyone is a suspected trickster please learn from my story if someone is calling you insane trying to convince you you re unwell and yet their story isn t adding up you re probably a victim of gaslighting and know that if your family make you a miserable a mine it s probably not your fault never lie to someone you love and most of all just because the world say you need to respect your parent doesn t make it so abusive parent are more common than you think and the odds are you or someone you know ha lived with them we need to rewrite this social norm for good you don t have to trust people for being related to you you don t have to love the mother that hit you the father that won t accept your identity the brother that call you name the sister that demoralizes you blood mean nothing but a string of genetic similarity you can define always for yourself who is family,1

this week she said sure and he said ok great 24th at 11 am so we can have 4 hour together before i go check this apartment out that i m gonna hire and they chatted a bit more then they sent kiss emojis and said okay see you tomorrow then on christmas eve he didn t text me at all the whole day until he called me at 4 pm after he had seen the apartment to tell me that he had decided on getting it and we only talked for 5 minute i pretended that i hadn t seen the message because it wa new year eve and i didn t wanna ruin the night the next day a we were driving i tried to see if he d confess so i casually asked him so she said we looked cute together did you guy meet at all now considering it wa holiday and stuff and he naturally replied nah we only talked a little on messenger she told me about her boyfriend but no generally i didn t even have time to go out with her he had plenty of time he wa free from work for 3 week and there were no message of her talking about her boyfriend who had a different name now surprisingly than in august when my boyfriend told me about him again he lied to my face when he had no reason to when i wa always cool with him if he met his ex why did he hide it why did he text her the very same day that i left why did he promise to always be honest and not hide anything and now did that how am i supposed to trust him again ever how am i supposed to trust myself not to go through his message i hate myself for doing it and i don t want to be that girlfriend but at least i got the truth from doing it when i could have been blind and getting a bad gut feeling with no way to explain it and tried to suppress it to not appear needy and insecure i m so torn and i love him so much i really thought like this could have been the real deal like we could have so much more to live and i believe that he truly love me but that he love her too and i don t know what to do i m hurting so bad i thought of leaving him a break up letter is that a wise decision tl dr boyfriend met up with ex during christmas holiday and didn t tell me i snooped through his message and found out but pretended i didn t know and gave him a chance to confess but he lied to my face telling me they didn t meet i m torn because i truly love him and he had promised to always be honest and never hide anything and now he did that and i don t know what to do,0

i became toxic and emotionally abusive at time and would like to share so i m25 wa in a relationship for a year and a half with a girl f19 and we lived together for a year we had our ups and down like any relationship but the end got quite messy and toxic due to my behavior at the start we were great together good hobby great friend good communication amazing sex we just clicked however towards the last few month of the relationship i became quite cold and distant thing about her for no reason just started to annoy me she became at time frustrating to be around and at a time where i should of opened up a line of communication i seemed to slowly sabotage the relationship instead by pushing her away i found myself belittling her teasing her about her weight and honing in on other insecurity she wasn t overweight at all and there wa nothing to gain from this other than to upset her i teased her about her skiing complained about the dish and purposely started to cause friction between u by systematically starting to break her down rather than build her up she is a very insecure person and is highly sensitive something i wa unaware of at the time and cried almost on a daily basis sometimes in regard to myself and sometimes due to other factor i took no joy in her feeling down and to be honest felt quite numb and indifferent to the relationship a a whole by this point she would message me cute text i would ignore she would ask me to visit during lunch i said i wa busy she would ask to make dinner plan i said i would rather stay at home when drunk i would say mean and irrelevant thing about past conversation or action that i found annoying just to fight with her which added to her anxiety i started to become le cuddly le enthusiastic about her i became colder during sex and wa uninterested in kissing all in which pushed her to becoming very clingy and needy towards me a she felt me fading pushing me further away and the vicious cycle would repeat we stopped date night and i replaced a lot of our time together with hanging out with friend instead trying to stay away from the house i would come home and she would be 2 tub of ice cream deep she started gaining weight and started to become a hermit only leaving the house for work this angered me and rather than communicating and solving the very obvious and underlying problem instead it only added fuel to the fire the last few month with me i know she had never felt more alone in her life despite this she wa still extremely warm and loving towards me which sickened me she would try to please me in any way and put me before herself i wa breaking her heart and eventually i came to my sens and realized i needed to leave her and let her be by this point she wa extremely codependent on me and didn t want me to go but despite that i left the relationship with hope of it being better for the both of u a individual a we both had our flaw to work on before being ready to commit to another all of this wa happening at a time of severe depression for myself and not only did i push her away but friend coworkers and the like a well at the time i had no emotional intelligence and wa out of my depth and so rather than confront my issue and open up a way to safely and openly communicate with each other in regard to the situation a well a who we once were and who we have become instead i just wanted to run it turn out we were in a anxious avoidant relationship looking back despite myself becoming fairly emotionally abusive and showing some strong narcissistic trait or trait typically found within narcissistic abuse syndrome although i don t believe i am narcissistic at all and being both quite toxic and selfish i don t believe i ever tried to manipulate her or control her in fact i encouraged her to make friend on numerous occasion to which she wa uninterested i encouraged her to pick up hobby and acted a her emotional support for matter which stemmed from outside the relationship and she wa free to hangout with whomever or do whatever she wanted for a large part of the relationship all i wanted wa u to be do individual choosing to be together a opposed to be reliant on each other and when she became codependent and i became cold and distant which ensured the beginning of our demise funny how now the main thing i miss is that very loving and clingy attitude she had towards me since the relationship i ve watched 100 of hour worth of therapy relationship emotional intelligence self aware and improvement video trying to better myself for not only my own mental well being but the well being of any future relationship i have book enrolled in a cbt course online and am enjoying the journey of self awareness yet i will always be ashamed of who i let myself become and am heartbroken at the thought of not getting to live my life with the love of my life due to my own issue i m constantly frustrated and saddened at the thought of being someone el cause of trauma and literally cry at the thought of leaving her a worse person and truly wish i could be by her side now to ironically build her back up from the pain i caused since the end i have learnt that a lot of this stemmed from my lack of emotional intelligence my previous inability to be emotionally available and emphatic and have pinned this down to myself having huge self esteem issue alongside insecurity and anxiety disorder i understand that i have these issue due to many reason along with one main focal point being that i myself found myself in an abusive relationship for which wa my first relationship which caused me many unresolved and repressed feeling typically related to intimacy so any people out there have been on the receiving end i am sorry the human mind is a complex tool and sometimes it can work with you and sometimes against you and i hope you know that not everyone is truly bad i believe people can change but from my two cent they can only change from their own self realization and draw a conclusion that they need to change for themselves,1
i m25 developed feeling for my friend f25 of one year and ended the friendship when i realized i couldn t get over them friend refuse to accept this and i am miserable i met laura about a year ago and we instantly hit it off and were friend all wa well until a couple month ago when i developed feeling for her seemingly out of nowhere i tried at first to just get over it and ignore those feeling in the hope of keeping the friendship but after awhile it wa clear that wasn t working so i bit the bullet and confessed to laura it wa awkward and painful a she kindly rejected my feeling we agreed to stay friend and while i tried after over a month it wa clear that i wasn t ok with just being friend anymore talking to her and being around her wa almost painful sometimes and it got to the point that i started ditching plan with her in order to avoid feeling like that i realized a few week ago that this wasn t fair to either of u since i wasn t being a real friend and i wa just being some asshole who viewed her a a potential girlfriend so i decided it wa best to just break off the friendship we don t have many mutual friend so it would be a relatively clean break in that regard i met with laura and explained how i felt and that i wanted to end thing she cried a lot and begged me not to do this to her i did my best to hold back cry and told her this wa for the best and left thing were quiet for a few day and i started to feel a bit better about my decision when laura started blowing up my phone begging to have our friendship back and to go back to the way thing were before i confessed she s even shown up to my place a few time according to my neighbor but i ve been picking up a lot of extra shift at work recently so i wasn t home either time she s also left some voicemail most of which have been her cry and apologizing for hurting me which is awful because it isn t her fault i have these feeling so at this point i m not sure if what i did wa right should i just go back to being friend with laura and hope these feeling go away or do i go full scorched earth here and block her i feel like such a monster hurting her like this but i don t know what else to do without making myself miserable tl dr i fell for a friend and wa rejected couldn t get over it and ended friendship but she won t stop begging for thing to go back to how they used to be i feel horrible,0

boyfriend just doesn t get it the other night my boyfriend went out with his friend i checked his location on snapchat to see if he wa home yet because i wanted to call him when i saw that he went to his work this wa late at night so he definitely wasn t doing anything for work there since they were closed what made me worried wa that we ve hooked up there before ever since then i ve had pent up anxiety over worrying about whether i can trust him i know it s paranoia i know it s unhealthy i know it s borderline obsessive and controlling i just need to trust him but my ex ha stared me right in the eye and promised me that he would never cheat on me then proceeded to give me chlamydia shortly after he looked me in the eye and lied to my face and told me he love me and he only want me while he wa fucking a new girl every week i ve been lied to so much and my trust in everyone ha been demolished logically i understand that these are two different people with a completely different set of moral but emotionally i can only anticipate the possible negative so that i might be better prepared to protect myself once the horrible truth come out i tried talking to my boyfriend about this last night it should be noted that not even a few day ago we had a similar discussion except that he initiated it and it wa about his trust issue i wa understanding validated his emotion and simply told him the truth that it s not in me to cheat on someone i love him and i m with him because i want him and only him my boyfriend got really irritated and defensive he said so what you want to break up i said no of course not i explained that i know these thought are irrational that s why i m telling him about them because sometimes i just need someone to tell me i m overthinking i told him i didn t want him to think that it s anything he did or that i m only thinking the worst about him it s just my mind looking back this is almost verbatim the thing he told me about his worry and trust issue maybe he s just not a good and intuitive at talking about emotion a i am but he kept saying thing that made me feel worse like i don t know why you feel this way i haven t done anything to make you think that like i get it but at the same time i don t i understand that it s frustrating to be with me i hate being like this too but i just can t shake the feeling that i could be getting fooled again he really is great he listens doe his best to make me happy make me laugh try new thing with me take me on adventure we usually have a great time together we ve been talking for about 8 month officially started dating 3 week ago i really shouldn t worry but i do and i m afraid it s going to sabotage everything,1

my story nsfw for language trigger i never thought i would get to the point of doing this yet i feel today after one of the most tumultuous day i ve had with my now ex partner i want to share my story and hear from others in regard to my situation i m going to try and consolidate the ending where thing became a terror when i first met my ex let call him paul for the sake of privacy and this is a throwaway account for a reason i wa 25 and he wa 32 initially my friend said she knew one of her boyfriend friend who she thought i might like so i asked to see a picture just for the sake of first impression lo and behold i thought he wa the most gorgeous man i had ever seen i told her he wa out of my league for sure and that i wasn t sure i d even try she convinced me to attend the party and said he would be there i arrive at the party he s the first one there and i wa immediately shook he wa gorgeous lovely sweet funny you name it i couldn t keep my eye off him we talked the whole night and got along incredibly well fast forward to the next morning and we seemed to have the nerve of what wa a blossoming romance after that day it wa history he called me every morning he made me laugh and i knew i wa falling in love within month we were smitten with each other and it wa beautiful we became the best of friend and had amazing sexual and loving chemistry the first argument i had with him wa strange it didn t seem that serious of a topic but he belittled me and made me feel stupid for having the opinion when i tried to explain myself i stormed off and then we soon gathered ourselves and everything resumed to it s amazing order i noticed immediately that he had some financial issue i wa giving him money here and there nothing crazy and he would often borrow cash for weed or smoke he d always be at the apartment with me because i loved his company and i wanted to make sure he wa happy and treated everyday albeit he went to work every day but he usually finished early and just passed out or got stoned and watched tv he would do nice thing during this time too such a bringing home flower all the time or picking up grocery and wine after work for u a time went on the financial issue were more insane he d need 300 for his car or 100 to deal with this that or the other i didn t understand why he had so little money when he worked so often this wa still early day maybe 4 month into the relationship i wa constantly picking up the cheque it didn t bother me because he explained previous debt from a company he owned and he seemed to get money back to me sometimes i tallied every dollar i gave to him fast forward a bit i started opening up about certain thing in my life i have alcohol dependency and i have struggled with that addiction since i wa about 20 he at first wa so understanding and opened up his cocaine addiction saying he would never make me feel bad about this a he needed help once too i told him later about being raped when i wa in university and he stormed off and lightly tried to claim it wa my fault because i put myself in that situation i told him about past problem in my previous relationship i wa a serial cheater in my longest relationship and that always lived with me i wa young unhappy and a coward and promised i would never do that to another man he seemed to be understanding about a lot of these thing but then i learned that wasn t the case at all i want to make this short a possible for you so let fast forward to where i am today i am out 11 500 because he ha refused to pay me back and i became his piggy bank his drug addiction became frequent and i wa influenced into this a well happily now have stopped completely whenever we fought he would bring up my past or name call here is a compiled list of the one i would hear serial cheater a slut a skank a tramp a whore a disgusting human garbage waste of flesh idiot stupid dummy aid bag cunt bitch drunken mess gypsy and many more i can t remember he would insult my family too i wa dumped a total of eight time in the relationship and after the fifth time i went out and got drunk a whole long weekend he wa calling me off the hook this weekend and also two woman he picked up were texting me calling me a whore from his phone i ended up sleeping with two people and he hacked my phone email social medium etc and found out about it he threatened me he said i wa disgusting and he would never touch me again because all i do is take cock from any guy that smile at me and i wa a cum dumpster i regretted sleeping with these people but i felt empty and i felt unworthy a i lay on my back for the second man i slept with all that repeated in my drunken head wa you re just a slut you deserve this this is what paul say you are we made up and then any time there wa a hint of doubt about my day it wa back to calling me a slut and telling me to go take another cock while i m drunk i wa so sorry for what i did i just wanted to be with him i never cheated on him when we were together though there is so much more to tell and so many more terrible story i can t help but feel broken on every level not only is my heart broken because i lost my best friend and the most beautiful man i d ever laid eye on i feel disgusting he said he ha two new girl that he is going on date with this weekend that he is going to fuck the shit out of he told me i wa ugly and compared me to them saying he wished he could send me picture of them i don t know what to do anymore please message me if you have a story to share back question or something to say thank you,1

feeling weirded out after my 30f first date with 39m red flag or am i overreacting last night i 30f had a first date with someone i met online 39m we d been talking for a couple week because i wa out of town and we decided to meet up a soon a i wa back which wa yesterday he offered to meet me at my place since i wa exhausted and sleep deprived from the long day of travel but i didn t feel comfortable with that for a few reason one we hadn t met at all in person yet and two i have a friend staying over in my little no privacy apartment for the holiday and it would just be too awkward so we ended up meeting in my neighborhood at a bar the date went well except for me being super out of it due to exhaustion partway through the date we made plan to meet up again the next day after i d gotten more sleep eventually it wa clear i wa crashing pretty hard so i told him i needed to get to bed and we could continue where we left off tomorrow after that i walked him back to his car and we kissed and started making out pretty hard neither of u are people who have sex on the first date but he wanted to come back to my place to continue the makeout sesh he clarified it wouldn t go beyond that i told him that would be tempting except for 1 my friend being there and definitely asleep by then it wa after midnight and no sound barrier in the apartment and 2 i really just needed to sleep i wa also fighting a cold and didn t want to mess up my immune system by going another night without much rest then we kept kissing by his car for awhile and he brought up the fact that he d packed an overnight bag just in case the date went so well that we didn t want to say goodbye to each other i made a comment about how that wa cute and then he seemed insistent that we go back to my place i told him again that my friend wa there and i have a very small apartment that offered no privacy he made a joke i thought it wa a joke that he d have some explaining to do to his roommate if he didn t come home that night i laughed and said i really needed to get some sleep i wa so tired i barely remember the rest of the conversation but eventually i told him you re staying here i m going home gave him one more kiss and started walking down the street to my apartment i turned back and said to text me when he got home safely it looked like he wa getting into his car a few minute later after i d gotten inside my apartment my phone started blowing up with call from him which i wasn t gonna answer because again my friend wa there sleeping six call in total then a bunch of text message asking where i went he wrote that he d been grabbing his overnight bag from his car to come with me and when he looked back i had disappeared i texted him back that we must have had a misunderstanding because again my friend wa staying over and also i didn t want to stay up any later and thought we were parting way for the night he seemed absolutely flabbergasted and confused that such a big miscommunication could have occurred and sent a few more text message grilling me about it am i going crazy did we not just have a conversation where i said i d have some explaining to do to my roommate for not coming home tonight etc i eventually just turned my phone off and went to sleep because it seemed ridiculous and i felt kind of creeped out i feel like there s no way he could have misunderstood me telling him over and over that someone else wa in my apartment and it wasn t appropriate to bring him back there and that i needed desperately to sleep but maybe i wa so tired that i wasn t explaining thing clearly the weird thing is he wasn t pushy at all during any other part of the date and kept asking if i needed to get home to sleep whenever i mentioned i wa tired thing only got weird after we started kissing i never got back to him about having another date today kinda ghosted him tbh and am trying to figure out whether i m overreacting or if this wa a red flag i really feel confused because the date went so well until everything seemed to blow up at the very end i plan on writing him tonight but i m not sure to give it another chance or cut it off here my question is doe this really sound like a miscommunication issue or doe anyone else think it wa kind of creepy tl dr i 30f went on a first date with someone i met online 39m and it we had a major misunderstanding at the end where i wanted to go home solo and sleep and he thought he wa coming back to my place with me i really can t understand how he misinterpreted what i wa saying but i want to make sure i m not overreacting before i assume there wa something creepy pushy going on,0

i feel so guilty i am leaving my significant others house today i told him i am staying with family while we figure thing out but i actually found an apartment i didn t want to tell him because i didn t want him to flip out on me the relationship ha been bad for a while i can t stand the way he talk to me the way he lord thing over my head to make me feel like i owe him the way he complains about the way i do chore the way he treat me like the slob when i m not the way he call me name when we fight the way that he doesn t listen when i tell him about my day the way he never take my side of the argument to heart the way he ha to always be right the reason i feel guilt is because i wonder if i could have tried harder when thing got bad i stopped giving him sex whenever he wanted i stopped doing my chore when he wanted me to i just emotionally checked out because i wa so tired and depressed it wa hard to always be wrong all the time i hated the way he demanded sex from me but when i asked for just a bit more affection and love from him he say he shouldn t have to do that to get sex from me he told me if i gave him more blowjob and sex then maybe he wouldn t ride me about chore all the time i m just so tired but i also feel guilty because i feel like maybe i should have done that for him i do love him maybe i should have tried harder he say if i leave i m giving up on u that i am running away i dunno i am just so sad and so lost and feel so much pain right now i don t know if i am doing the right thing sometimes i wonder if i wa the toxic one,1
me 23f and my partner 23m fighting about how he treat my thing so me and my partner moved in together towards the end of august and for the most part it s been great he doe his share of work around the house and he is a lot of fun to live with amongst other thing however recently we ve started arguing a lot most of these argument are little thing and we ve been dealing with them well we ve tried to compromise where necessary and hear each other out but this morning we ve had a really bad one and i don t know what to do about it i recently passed my driving test and have my first car it wa my mum s old 2002 seat ibiza nothing super special but i m over the moon about finally having the freedom that come with a car my partner borrowed it on saturday to drive his friend to a match and i got in this morning to drive to work and it is a mess there is bread all over the seat from his friend eating a whole baguette for lunch and the petrol tank is close to zero to the extent that the low petrol warning light started beeping on my journey i wa and i think reasonably very frustrated he d left the car like this and messaged him to tell him i wasn t happy he said sorry but then moved on to saying i wa always pressing him about the car and i m too precious with it the argument escalated to the point that i told him i wa just so frustrated with him breaking my stuff and leaving a mess i shouldn t generalise but it s true he s broken my bin by smacking a wooden spoon on it to get the food off he broke the car cigarette lighter because he put his key on it and they got jammed inside the other day he rubbed his muddy shoe on my rug because he wa trying to get them off i know these are accident etc but it upset me to see him treating my stuff like this i should clarify i know he doesn t mean to break thing or make a mess but it just feel so careless and he hasn t actually replaced or fixed any of the thing he s broken yet and the bin wa broken like 5 month ago before he even moved in he is now angry because he feel i hold him to too high a standard and i m always having go at him for breaking or messing stuff up i ve explained that it upset me seeing the thing i ve worked hard for or the thing i ve received a gift broken but i don t think he fully appreciates that he s now suggesting that maybe we shouldn t live together because of this but all i want is for him to be more careful and to replace or fix the thing he break i want to live with him and most of the time it s amazing but i just want him to be more considerate with my thing tldr my partner seems to be careless with my thing and is now angry and upset that i ve called it out,0

many one serious girlfriend before her she never dated around and ha only ever been with me before we got married we had a lengthy discussion about how she would feel knowing that she never got to experience another relationship it wa a non issue for her we were madly in love throughout our marriage she ha made many girl friend and made a point to make sure she could maintain the relationship two year ago we moved to a new city so i could pursue graduate school and a always she wa able to make friend we have two daughter so these friend are usually other mother with kid the same age and they have play date together since the start of the school year she ha made friend with a stay at home dad that ha a son that is in the class with our youngest daughter this man is also married and ha a brand new baby i have never met him in person before i didn t think anything of it and just assumed that she did what she always doe and make friend however this is the first time in our 10 year marriage that it ha been with a man about a month ago my oldest daughter wa having some anxiety about going to school and it wa really making the morning difficult for u my wife generally brings her to the bus stop and see her off but one day she refused to get on and just bursted our cry giving all sort of reason why she didn t want to go my wife ended up having to drive my daughter to the school and it wa a very emotional thing for both of them right after she took my other daughter to her school the one with the male friend and when my wife got home you could tell it had hit her pretty hard i wa consoling her when her phone get a text from this male friend he wa asking her if she wa okay i don t know what it wa about the text but it just came at the worst time and really gave me this terrible feeling i wa filled with this jealously that this other man wa close enough to my wife that he would reach out to her about this topic it honestly sound stupid that i would get jealous over it but it just felt like that that issue with my daughter wa a family matter not something that belongs to a friend of a few month this is where it started i started wondering how often they text what we re texting about wa she making an emotional connection with another man wa i going to be replaced emotionally by this man nothing in our past ha ever given me reason to have these question but they constantly flooded my mind a couple day later i talked to her i honestly felt so embarrassed to bring it up but i wanted to let her know that i felt uncomfortable that she wa texting this man i explained that i didn t want her to end her friendship but that it wa on my mind i thought maybe she would reassure me or maybe even limit the friendship she responded with i m sorry that you feel that way but i am not going to stop being friend with someone i totally get that and i definitely wasn t saying end the friendship over the the next few week i started really getting insecure about the whole thing to the point where it woke me up at night fantasizing all of these terrible scenario and to my shame cry over the fear of losing my wife i reiterate nothing at this point ha indicated that anything more than friendship ha happened but in those week we would talk about it and she would tell me that nothing wa happening i would be okay for a few day and then something would trigger the fear again sometimes not even my wife it could be something a dumb a a funny video on reddit that happened to be about affair it felt like it wa popping up everywhere and i just couldn t get it off of my mind at this point i feel like my wife is tired of reassuring me and i feel like i am smothering her with the need for attention because it make me feel like better this past weekend i wa feeling down and my wife talked to me she said that she is sorry that she doesn t know how to make me feel better about this somehow this conversation led to our premarriage discussion and she said that she wanted to be honest that she ha been thinking about talking to me about an open marriage she said that it ha nothing to do with this friend and that she ha been having the feeling since the beginning of the year she started a job and now interacts with a lot of people childfree i basically told her that based on how i felt with the fact that she wa friend with a guy that there is no way that i could be comfortable with her having sex with someone else i don t know if i wa just being fearful about the possibility of an affair but i started a conversation about it with her last night basically asking question on how it would work would it be a one time thing would it be someone she know part of me understand the interest in sex with someone else because she never got to experience a relationship with anyone but me however her answer were that she would want it to be with someone she wa comfortable with not a stranger and she doesn t know if it would need to be a one time thing these were all red flag for me because it just seems like she wanted to see other people wanting to have an emotional and sexual connection with someone else she then told me that she would never do anything to jeopardize our marriage and she want to be with me forever and then i made a mistake i wa feeling fine today and it seemed like everything wa going to work out but out of curiosity i wa on our cell phone account and i couldn t help myself to look at the text log it doesn t show the text but just when they happen and to who i wa horrified to find that she text this male friend a lot throughout the day it s always initiated by him but some of the text are a early a 7 30 am they text a lot during the day between the hour that our youngest is in school half day then the text stop occasionally they happens in the evening but not a much i am so ashamed of what i have done looking at the log but now i can t unsee it what make it worse is that surrounding our talk about an open marriage she had a full text conversation today they texted back and forth for nearly 3 hour i don t know what to do should i bring up that i saw the log i feel that bringing it up would make everything worse and that i invaded her privacy i don t want to keep being this person who is a burden on their wife with made up insecurity i feel like an asshole but i am falling apart here please help me tldr wife make first male friend in ten year of marriage i get extremely insecure about the friendship we have lot of talk but she will remain friend with him had a last talk about open marriage but definitely not with the guy i looked at text log and see they talk all the time,0

i 27m just broke up with my girlfriend 23f because she wa being too jealous imo obligatory throwaway account amp x200b tldr at the bottom amp x200b i ll start with some back story my girlfriend s ex cheated on her multiple time so my girlfriend i guess ex girlfriend ha trust issue now i really like her and think that other than that she s a pretty great person so i thought i d wait and hope she could eventually come to trust me about a month ago she saw some scratch on my back she made them but had somehow forgotten about it so she accused me of cheating i never have and never will cheat so i of course got angry told her she made them said that i couldn t be with someone who trusted me a little a she did and left amp x200b she kept messaging and called after a few minute i answered and she asked me to come back after thinking for 20 30 minute i decided to go back and at least have a proper talk with her i told her how being falsely accused of doing something so horrible made me feel but that i wa trying to understand her perspective after having been cheated on multiple time she said she didn t doubt what i wa saying about the scratch anymore and wa starting to trust me more so i decided to give it another try but told her that next time she accused me of doing something like this that i didn t do with no proof i wa ending it immediately and cutting contact amp x200b fast forward to today a few hour ago she s out of town for a work training program for work she had just finished for the day and called me i wa walking to the train to go back to the city i live in and continue working some more a i had free time i answered and told her i wasn t going to be able to talk for long a i couldn t talk on the train and i wouldn t be able to when i got back to work amp x200b she call again while i m working and i don t answer but i finished about 5 minute later i call her back and this time she doesn t answer i wait 10 minute then go take a shit she call again and i ignore because i don t like talking on the phone while i m using the toilet she call back a minute later and i answer she say she s angry call me a liar and accuses me of cheating she say the reason i kept missing her call wa because i wa trying to hide a girl from her i tell her i m on the toilet and even switch to video chat gross i know but she wa having none of it she kept calling me a piece of shit and so on amp x200b so i said i wa done i could no longer deal with a girlfriend who doesn t trust me when i ve never lied to her i said she need to quit judging people based on what her ex did and that i m not him she said whatever i said fuck you and hung up i do regret the fuck you honestly i then sent her a message with my address so she could send my key back told her not to contact me after and said i couldn t deal with a crazy girlfriend like her i also kinda regret calling her crazy even though i really do think she is amp x200b i guess i want some advice reinforcement about what to do if she try to get back together a i honestly think she probably will i love her but know it s not really a healthy relationship at this point and i don t want my head to lose to my heart but i will freely admit that it very well may amp x200b some additional information history in no particular order that may or may not really be necessary we live in japan so counseling therapy aren t much of a thing here before we had sex the first time she asked how many people i d had sex with so i told her honestly only 3 and she still doesn t believe this she said she would say after but then never did she said she cheated on the ex who wa repeatedly cheating on her but only once and she only got lunch with the other guy later she said she cheated on him multiple time but still insists she only ever got lunch with the guy she point out other girl that she think are attractive then get mad when i look i m also currently running a fever and have been for over a week she know this a she wa staying at my place before she left town and could feel the heat radiating from me she play off not being able to trust me a no big deal because she only trust her brother her mother and one of her friend she constantly go out drinking and to club and then get mad when i don t tell her not to go she think it mean i don t care what she doe and call me cold my opinion is she s a grown woman if she feel guilty about something she s doing or would feel bad if i did what she s doing then she need to set the boundary herself i m her boyfriend not her parent i m not going to tell her what to do or not to do if she cross a line that i can t deal with then i ll break up with her if i think of anything to add i ll do so thanks for taking the time to read if you did so it ended up being longer than i thought but getting all this out wa a bit cathartic i think tldr girlfriend accuses me of cheating i don t cheat and say next time she falsely accuses me i m ending the relationship right then she accuses me again while she s out of town i break up with her and want the internet to talk me out of taking her back if she try to get back together,0

i 29f just found out my ex 37m is getting married i didn t know he wa dating anyone and we ve continued hooking up monthly since the breakup my ex 37m and i 29f have been broken up for about a year we had been together for three year we both have our own business and are fairly independent and travel a lot and therefore had separate house and never lived together full time the breakup wa really painful for me because i wa still very much in love with him but could feel him start to lose interest and drift off basically ghosting me while away on a trip one time and when i had to leave shortly after that for a trip of my own he told me over the phone while i wa away that he wa still in love with me but he thought we should change the nature of our relationship because it wa too hard with u both being away so much i wa devastated amp x200b about a month later when we were both back home in the same town he asked to see me we had sex we told each other we loved each other it felt pretty much the same a when we were together another month went by we would text about once a week always romantic or sexy and about once a month for the next year we d meet back up and hook up sometimes me asking to see him sometimes him asking to see me sometimes his place sometimes mine i never asked if he wa seeing anyone and he never asked me i would go through wave of wanting him back but still had a lot of pain around the breakup so i never asked if we could go back to the way thing were amp x200b then about a month ago he asked to see me he invited me to a rental villa he owns not his own house fair enough a it s closer to my place and i figured we were just meeting up for a quickie we talked for a bit then went to the bedroom started kissing and he told me passionately that he love me we start getting undressed and he say yours is still my dream body the perfect woman we had amazing sex unprotected a always i m on birth control and both ended up in loving tear he wa cry telling me how he s never missed or wanted an ex like this before how this is always going to be what our connection is like how much he love me he told me he s thought about me every fucking day since we broke up me too and wake up in the morning feeling like he s screaming out my name i felt it too super powerful emotion it wa really intense i had to run to work after that so we didn t really get to talk about what it all meant for our future amp x200b after i left i didn t hear from him at all for two day which wa pretty unusual for him so i got worried he almost never post anything on social medium at all his last picture on instagram are from a trip we took together a year ago but i started digging in his tagged photo which i never did before because i wa trying to heal from the break up so i avoided looking at his profile saw a girl tagged in a pic with him clicked her profile and sure enough over the past year she ha ton of picture posted with him and her most recent one of them together wa hashtagged futuromarido from two week prior i felt like i had been suckerpunched amp x200b i freaked the fuck out started screaming at him via text that he had to tell her what he did or that i would tell her i went nut he eventually agreed to meet up with me broke down cry told me he had started seeing her while we were still together when he ghosted me that she didn t know we were still hooking up begged me not to tell her etc i tried to get him to agree to tell her but he wouldn t he just said i ve apologized to her for any way i ve hurt her she wouldn t want to know don t i deserve happiness i will be a better person to her i promise etc etc i wa so angry and disgusted with him and so wanting to run away from it all that i let it go amp x200b so basically he s a piece of shit and i dodged a huge bullet by not ending up with him my sadness about the breakup immediately switched to rage at him and a deep pity for her 25f by the way i thought our age difference wa big but she s 12 year younger than him i started viewing her like a little sister i want to protect from making this huge mistake i have such a huge sadness for her to be marrying someone who would not only cheat unprotected continually but also say those thing to another woman after being engaged to her dream body perfect woman screaming out your name etc etc i tried to forget about it and let it go but still now more than a month after that discovery i feel absolutely sick to my stomach with guilt knowing that she is going to marry him without knowing he s been unfaithful to her their entire relationship amp x200b is it my place to tell her i thought i had decided to definitely not tell her and just let their life play out a it will but it s still keeping me up at night what would you do amp x200b tl dr after continuing to hook up with my ex every month for a year i found out he s engaged to be married to a woman he s kept hidden from me we slept together after they were already engaged and he said he wa still in love with me he s trash but do i tell her he cheated so she know what she s dealing with or is the desire to do that just some deep part of me wanting revenge amp x200b moral of the story don t sleep with your ex,0

forgave me for telling lie about him and that nobody would love me except for him because i wa a liar we started dating in late 2018 immediately when we started dating he became possessive whenever we were out with friend he would always have his arm around me be hugging me or holding my hand i have mild aspergers a form of autism so physical touch can make me uncomfortable at time and make me panic he wa aware of this and i told him that the constant physical contact wa sweet but it did make me feel uncomfortable sometimes and i wanted him to tone it down he told me to stop being dramatic and that i needed to loosen up he did not tone it down it soon turned to grabbing my face forcing me to kiss him and physically restraining me my friend around me did not like to watch him always touching me so they didn t pay much attention to u but often i would try to walk away from him to talk to one of my friend and he would firmly grab my wrist or the collar of my shirt and not let me walk away i soon began to feel very depressed when we were in a group environment he would not let me speak with my friend i had to stay by his side the whole time and whenever i tried to say something to the group he would interrupt speak over me he would then tell me in private that i wa annoying and spoke too much and that it annoyed everybody except him so i should only talk to him then at some point during the new year my family had a new year party at which i wa drinking i messaged joshua explaining that i wa drinking and he seemed okay about it i told him i wouldn t be able to talk too much later that night he wa messaging me so i replied explaining how i had drunk too much and i felt sick he went crazy saying i shouldn t have gotten drunk and that i wa a disgusting alcoholic i wa not an alcoholic i rarely drunk even socially this wa for a new year party and that i had become disgusting just like the rest of your family i ended up passing out and waking up to paragraph from him in the morning about how disgusted he wa and how he hated me and wanted to break up with me i felt so guilty like i had done something wrong so i apologised and explained that i would understand if he felt he needed to break up with me he said he forgave me but that i would need to redeem myself by sending him nude picture so i did over the next few month thing unraveled further i found myself talking le and le around him because whenever i talked about my life he would point out something that i had done wrong that offended him and found new way for me to redeem myself he also restricted my interaction with friend at first it wa just how i appeared when i saw friend he made me send him a picture of my makeup hair and outfit every day before i left the house i wasn t allowed to wear skirt singlet legging or tight shirt if he wasn t there he didn t let me wear makeup around my friend a he felt i wa trying to impress someone that wasn t him and he didn t like that and he didn t like the smell of my makeup or the feel of it so i wasn t allowed to wear it around him either it made me very sad because makeup wa a passion of mine he didn t like when i wore low ponytail even to my workplace which wa the standard hairdo for woman at my work because it wa unflattering and he told me that i wore a low ponytail on purpose to upset him eventually i wasn t allowed to go to my friend house anymore he said it wa inappropriate for me to hang out with anyone that isn t him because i m bisexual which he disliked and that meant that it wa always a date when i hung out with other people and that i wa cheating on him many of my friend and family began warning me saying i should break up with him and that he wa manipulating me i always said that he wa better once you got to know him and that he wa just misunderstood i truly believed that he messaged me every second of every day and got mad when my reply were over 10 minute late whenever this happened he made me redeem myself eventually he decided that i wa spreading rumour about him no evidence of this and made me give him my instagram password i use instagram a my main social medium platform and it is my main form of communication with my friend so he could log in on his phone and monitor my conversation and search history i gave him my password he monitored my every conversation so eventually i stopped talking to most of my friend i did have one close male friend tim who stuck by my side through it all he saw i wa being manipulated knew that joshua had my account but still messaged me encouraging me to break up with him saying that my situation wa so toxic and i didn t realise it because i wa being manipulated this wa around the time that i had my first falling out with joshua in person and he held me in a headlock until i wa unconscious it wa the first time i had truly spoken my mind to him something that made thing difficult wa that i loved joshua s family recently i have realised that his dad wa a terrible person but being so close to them and them always complimenting me and saying how beautiful and smart i wa made me feel special and loved almost part of the family which they said i wa however they started saying strange thing to me saying i needed to leave my family and move country with them without telling anyone they said that my family were disgusting and they would help to take me away to the other side of the world where i could marry joshua and get pregnant a soon a possible this family wa not religious just crazy the more that tim tried to help me the more aggressive that joshua got he said that tim wa crazy and in love with me and that i needed to cut communication with him i said i didn t want to so joshua told me i wasn t allowed to speak to anyone about our relationship he told me that speaking to anyone else about our relationship wa cheating and that his parent forbid me from doing it or i would be disowned i just agreed saying i wouldn t do it anymore so i didn t i began to lose many of my friend and my family tried to stop me from seeing joshua none of my family liked him joshua soon began ranting to me about his racist idea saying that dark skinned people were biologically inferior and that woman were only meant to have child not to follow their dream or have job this is when my eye were opened i realised what kind of person he wa and that i needed to escape the situation that night i went to a party got drunk and text dumped joshua who said i would regret it all of my friend who were at the party cheered hugged me some even cried they were so relieved that i escaped the horrible relationship since then joshua ha put nude drawing that he drew of me in my mailbox sent me several letter he sent me a letter every single day which elaborated on a feature that he loved about me and written a 20 page book about our relationship a4 page i have blocked him from everything and after receiving several text from his number saying to unblock him and that he wa the only person who loved me i blocked his number too after figuring out how lol he ha followed me in public place he ha not stalked me to find me but we live in a fairly small city so sometimes we are coincidentally in the same place he also life 5 minute away from me i have not heard from him or seen him in about a week which is a new record i think i hope this is over now we broke up about 4 month ago i am now in a new relationship with a truly lovely man named jake it make him sad when i ask for permission to go out and see friend he say i should never have to ask for permission he never pressure me we don t message constantly and my family and friend adore him he always tell me how he think i m perfect he s very smart and hard working i couldn t be happier and now i know the warning sign of an abusive relationship tldr abusive ex boyfriend controlled every aspect of my life wouldn t let me see friend wear certain thing him and his family tried to make me move country with them without telling anyone broke up with him and am now in a happy and healthy relationship,1

my 26f partner 26m want to edit all the nude i ve sent him into a video am i being unreasonable for not wanting him to yesterday my partner of one year told me he wa going to edit the sexual video and photo i ve sent him over the past year into a video with music etc the idea of it made me feel sick and disgusting but i don t fully understand why nor can i articulate it he told me if i wanted to do the same with stuff he s sent me he would be happy that i wa enjoying it in the medium that i wanted here is why i think i m so averse to it 1 the kind of nude and video i take require a lot of hard work and effort to pull off it s not a matter of simply laying down and snapping a photo getting the lighting angle changing into the attire setting up my camera and then taking endless photo trying to find the right one where both my body and face are controlled in a way where the overall output actually look sexually appealing can take a very long time slapping them into a video almost make me feel all the hard work i put into them doesn t amount to something good enough for him 2 for me it feel like it take some of the personal element out of the thing i ve sent him it s no longer about me curating my look in a way that i want him to see me now he ha the master key in selecting my image and putting them together in a way he want to see me this feeling is one of the more poorly understood one from my point of view i can t really think of why it s so wrong for him to want to see me how he want to see me 3 i think i have a fear of how exactly he s going to edit them is my face going to be removed is he going to only choose pic that show my as and not my boob i feel like knowing how he s going to edit them will reveal something about the way he think about me or my body that wouldn t make me feel good about myself 4 i don t like feeling like i m any other woman he can box into his porn amv i totally get that they are my nude and i can simply tell him that it make me uncomfortable and a my boyfriend he should respect that i don t need a valid reason to tell him not to this post isn t about that though i m trying to understand my own action and whether from a completely rational standpoint my reasoning for feeling uncomfortable about them would make sense to any other person tldr partner want to curate his own porn amv with my nude it make me uncomfortable but i can t tell if what i m feeling is reasonable,0
i 25m don t want to really ever hug my sister 14f anymore basically because she ha boob after being pressed about it i told her and it hurt her i kinda feel like a bad person now and don t know what to do i don t feel too comfortable hugging her so i kinda lean forward from afar to just come in contact at the shoulder preferably she must have noticed and asked me about it recently i gave her a roundabout answer about not feeling like it s appropriate anymore but she said she didn t mind and thought it wa ok she then said it felt like i wa treating her differently and she didn t like it i told her that honestly it wa because i didn t want to feel her chest when getting close she said that wa a mean thing to say and then she said a very teenager thing about not even wanting me close anyway so i don t know i feel like i messed up being honest but also i can t think of how i could have said it in a way that wouldn t hurt her i m not revolted by the idea of being close to her just not particularly eager to give her front hug we ve always been close so it s not like i m walking away from her or anything that dramatic i feel like she s kinda exaggerating but at the same time i don t know i can see why she could feel rejected but it s not like i m distant with her i still give her silly nose boops little pat on the back kiss her cheek when greeting little thing like that she s not gonna die from not getting hug so i m leaning towards her taking this a little out of proportion but still feel bad that my feeling hurt her is there anything i should or can do is this like a common thing for girl tl dr sister wa hurt to know i don t give her regular hug because of her chest don t know if i should say or do something in particular or kinda just let it go,0

my 31m boyfriend 30m lack basic life skill we ve been dating about 14 month and living together for about 6 month that s sooner that i typically would have moved in with someone but some life circumstance somewhat related to this post actually occurred that made it make a lot of sense for u to move in together when we did he is 30 and lack a lot of what i would consider to be very basic life skill for someone his age he cannot cook i don t mean that he doesn t cook much or that he would prefer not to i mean that he flat out doe not understand the first thing about food preparation and ha never possessed the slightest inkling of intellectual curiosity to teach himself how he hate the grocery store because he ha no idea what he s doing there i asked him to stop and get some chicken on his way home once and he legitimately got anxiety about it because he had never bought chicken before in his life and didn t have a clue how we generally get along well but one of the bigger conflict that we ve had since moving in involves housekeeping i keep a pretty tidy place and while he isn t the filthiest person on earth it s a constant battle to get him to chip in he doesn t clean up after himself and leaf thing like candy wrapper and napkin all over the house the other day he wa having some peanut butter and cracker in the kitchen when he wa done he simply walked off without putting anything away he didn t even put the damn lid back on the peanut butter i don t expect a spotless house but i do expect anyone i m living with to chip in on housework and clean up after themselves he is not consistent with either i don t feel like i should have to teach a 30 year old man how to keep a decent house his behavior bleeds into his work life a well he s on his third position same company thankfully since we ve started dating and he hasn t liked any of them he hasn t been particularly successful with any of them and seems to almost be bouncing around without finding any real stability i m starting to worry that the common denominator is him he want a better job or a career that he like more but he doesn t seem to have any real drive to actually do anything about it it wa a struggle to get him to meet any of my friend when we first started dating because he feel socially awkward and inadequate compared to a lot of people we are going to a dinner party with some of my more interesting friend this weekend and he s been terrified about it all week because they re all pretty successful people and he doesn t know what to say or how to have a conversation with a group of people he feel threatened this one is especially weird to me because they re all super nice people who would never look down on someone for the thing he s worried about i ve been coaching him here and there this week on thing he could talk about or bring up but honestly it feel ridiculous to have to do so people who have been in this position is there any hope are there any thing i can do to push him in a positive direction tl dr my boyfriend is lacking basic skill in a lot of area home work social is there any chance of improvement or is this just how it s gonna be,0

my bestfriend ha d i d and and said that i hit her face she had always gotten into abusive relationship i remember she always had bad mood swing in high school resulting in her lashing out at me whenever something bad happened to her i wa aware she wa abusive towards me at some point but i loved her so much she wa so important to me she wa a digital artist like me and had all my interest too i didnt even care if she hurt me a long a we could talk her current boyfriend would hit her and cheat on her alot and i remember trying really hard to be there for her even tho she wa very snappy but then one night she made a very bad joke about slitting my throat if i ever upset her brother and i felt like that wa too dark for me i wa often verbally and physically abused by my older brother in which death threat would be passed through our argument and it just made me so fucking upset i texted her at night because i stay up very late with my boyfriend telling her to not to threaten me like that a calmly a possible and she fucking snapped at me to not to text her at such a late hour and compared to someone she knew i really hated for acting insufferable towards me and her she told me to reavulate myself about her hurting me and then told that i wa more likely to hurt her because one time i slapped her face because she made fun of acne i had in high school i don t remember hitting her ever i know her boyfriend would slap and hit her but when she said that i wa so distraught i even questioned myself if i did do it but literally have no memory of what she recalled i remember walking by her and she made a sim character named black head my name to mock me and i pushed her away but i absolutely dont remember hitting her at all i think she is projecting her insecurity with her own morality and her abusive relationship with her current boyfriend i remember she panicked to tell me one of her alters pulled a knife on him and demanded him to undress and raped him i witnessed her throwing his phone out in a concert parking lot because he simply made a comment about an unfunny vine and she said i thought it wa funny and demanded he pick up the phone in front of me i sent him note from my phone telling him that i wa so fucking sorry this is happening and i left so that that situation could resolve yet every week or two she would tell me she would end up hitting or beating her from the fight they got into i remember trying to be kind at first when she snapped and denying her allegation saying to get some rest until she come back to her sens she texted me youre right i guess it s what a sociopath would say which wa her sarcastic way of saying hey your treating me like a monster when all i ever said wa to not threaten me but a i laid at night i remember all the fall out we would have that result cut contact from week to month and at some point it turned to two year i remember how painful it wa to go without her because she wa like the light of my life she wa smart funny beautiful and talented and when i went without her i would feel alone and lost with myself but why why doe it all always have to go to shit like this i snapped i texted her to never fucking comeback to me every again after she told my friend that i couldnt take a fucking joke and i wa too sensitive i had never wanted physically choke out someone in my life for the record i didnt then she went on social medium saying how all my friend sided with her and that i wa being dramatic and crazy i went from wanting to choke her out to just wanted to destroy every fucking fiber of her i felt so fucking destroyed after we stopped talking my boyfriend had to hold me until i calmed down he always suggests i just stay away from her for good but how how i know it s her alter talking i know it him and not her i love her so much and all i want is to be friend again but how after i cursed at her about being a rapist and an abuser and to never come back when i didnt mean it the worst had came out from me again and again because of the way she started fight this happend 10 month ago and i still get dream of all the verbal abuse i took from her alters and the fall out we had it fucking haunt me and yet i miss her and i feel like a fucking fool for wanting to just be friend again what wrong with me i feel like i m broken i feel like she broke me even after 10 month i feel so lost and alone still without her i cant believe even 2 year of her couldnt make me forget her i even took 3 year of therapy from all of this i just want to bash my head in so bad from all of this please someone just kill me,1

exploring sexuality and intimacy after an abusive relationship i 26f posted in this thread recently about my recent decision to leave an emotionally and verbally abusive relationship with my husband 36m it s been about a month since moving out of our apartment and i quite literally feel a though i am suffering powerful withdrawal on a physical level i crave his body his touch his scent his physical presence etc i know trauma bond are a legitimate thing and the fact that i m at my peak fertility probably doesn t help haha i know it make sense that i miss cuddling with him sleeping with him and just generally being intimate with him but i am horny all the time and feel at a loss of how to deal with my insanely strong libido in a healthy and mindful way other than masturbating of course or watching porn the thing is my husband wa the first person i d ever had sex with and to this day ha been my only sexual partner needle to say ever since telling him i am done with our relationship and fed up with his bullshit i have started to take interest in learning more about myself sexually speaking e g i always thought i wa heterosexual and strictly into monogamy but am now questioning this pretty seriously throughout the course of our relationship we had a relatively good sex life but there were certain thing that really left a bitter and uncomfortable taste in my mouth for example he would ask me to take nude then criticize me for not taking good enough picture or he would say i wa neglecting him when i didn t want to wear lingerie all the time or dress up for him he would also get insanely furious and frustrated when he couldn t give me an orgasm and basically made me feel bad for not cumming in hindsight this sound so fucked up and i can t believe i didn t see that anyhow i feel a though i have so much to explore and learn about my sexuality and fantasize about so many thing but in reality am somewhat terrified at the thought of hooking up with someone or having casual sex it s just be super hard and scary for me to imagine trusting someone on an intimate sexual level or being vulnerable with them given everything that happened in my relationship plus i ve never hooked up with anyone casually before and although the thought of it turn me on quite a bit i know that fantasy and reality are two different realm i am going to a counselor every week and seeking out resource at a local woman s shelter and i also have some great support system among my friend i suppose i wa just curious about how others have navigated this tricky issue after leaving an abusive relationship i know i don t need to rush anything just curious and wanting to learn more thanks in advance everyone,1
my 21f boyfriend 22m ha decided when he want u to get engaged and say it s a dealbreaker throwaway because he s on reddit a lot for context i m a junior at university in a small college town we ve been seeing each other on and off for about two year in a committed relationship for one he s a senior at the same school so we spend pretty much all our time together we have a good relationship i love him a lot and he make me really happy he s told me that he plan to propose after i graduate so in about a year and a half spring 2021 i ll be moving to the other side of the country for grad school straight after and we won t be able to see much of each other for a couple year i ve told him this is too soon for me i ll be 22 which imo is too young for me to be engaged and it just isn t the right time and i think being engaged and then going into a ldr would be really hard in the relationship his argument is that marriage is something that matter a lot to him for what i believe are family reason it s not a no sex before marriage situation but his folk are pretty conservative i guess this is the reason though he won t explain exactly why it s so important and if we don t commit to engagement now then he want to break up didn t know this when i got into the relationship btw i love him deeply and want to spend my life with him but the idea of engagement and marriage so soon he want a 3 year engagement make me really anxious and i don t know at this stage if it s going to work out with our different life goal we re both very ambitious and i don t know if we ll end up with job in the same place etc i ve told him in the past i d get engaged to him to avoid this issue which i feel wa probably a mistake but i really didn t want to lose the relationship to complicate this we have a lot of mutual friend and extracurriculars that we ve been working on together and if we broke up we might lose all of that would it be dumb to throw away a relationship that make me really happy along with all our mutual friend just because i have some doubt about this engagement that wouldn t be for 18 month anyway tldr boyfriend want u to get engaged after i graduate and if i don t agree now he want to break up,0

i faced my abuser in person after 3 year for a bit of background we dated on and off for year he s 11 year older than me yet began first showing interest in me when i wa 16 i know now that he groomed me he love bombed me a lot at first but he wa incredibly narcissistic and manipulated me into turning against my own friend and family it all finally ended when i broke up with him with a friend beside me for support and he reacted by punching me to the ground getting on top of me choking me then proceeding to latch onto my finger with his teeth a i tried to smush his face to get him to stop choking me my friend saved my life that night but he sadly passed away earlier this year rest in peace james since this happened there s been drib and drab of him attempting to contact me there wa obviously a court case then fake social medium account to hurl abuse at me and also hearing ridiculous rumour about myself that obviously came from him a bunch of therapy ptsd treatment antibiotic and surgery to save my chewed up finger later he approached me in a pub i wa at the bar and he sat next to me and smugly said hey jac i didn t even look because i knew it wa him so i walked away i went outside for a cigarette and he stood right behind me the whole time breathing down my neck while i wa talking to people a few people there were giving me a worrying look of there s some f cking weirdo standing right behind you but i just carried on chatting laughing and being my usual bubbly self on a night on the town i didn t even look at him every time he tried to get my attention i just completely disregarded him and carried on smiling and chatting away i couldn t even tell someone what he look like now because i barely got a glimpse of him i think he wanted a reaction out of me and however much i d love to inflict the same pain that he did to me tenfold he s not worth it i didn t give him anything and he must ve looked like an absolute weirdo to everyone there i feel really proud of myself on how i handled it but obviously it s brought back a lot of old feeling of fear it s the first time i ve been in an enclosed space with him since he attacked me and i thought i would ve just straight up had a panic attack in that situation i really underestimated myself i did break down once i got home because holding it so tightly together really took up a lot of energy but i feel that it wa worth it i could ve just left the pub but i don t want him to believe that he ha any control over me i really hope that somehow james could see me face him like that,1
my 20 m straight girlfriend 20 f recently figured she s bi of 7 month lied about kissing her childhood friend 18 f 5 month ago when they were inebriated and her friend suggested kissing to figure out if they were bisexual this happened 36 hour ago and i am still a little dazed created this throwaway yesterday but couldn t get myself to write about it until now so here go the most confused me writing about something that ha deeply hurt me and asking for your advice i ll start with some background information i have dated a few people since high school and have been through some good and bad relationship took a year long hiatus before my current relationship to work on insecurity and expectation issue after a series of mildly bad relationship my current girlfriend who i ll refer to a g henceforth and i were friend for around a year grew closer over the 4 5 month prior to u dating before we started dating in april this year this is g s very first relationship and i wa a little scared in the beginning if that would lead to some issue mostly if i would be able to stand up to her expectation etc but it hasn t we discussed this in the beginning honestly this relationship is one based on a level of understanding that i had never experienced before at the risk of sounding cheesy this is one of those relationship that made me so happy that i would randomly break into dancing if listening to music when walking for breakfast anyway more about g she is the kind of person who would keep thing to herself because she doesn t want to confront someone a she doesn t like conflict she like thing around her being simple even if it mean that is at the cost of her own well being all of u close to her keep pushing her to work on that and she ha been a well there ha been a lot of development in the past few month anyway when we started dating she wa confused about her sexuality she had been for a while before we did and wanted to see if she wa bisexual we had discussion about it and she would ask me thing i didn t know the answer to i would reach out to my female friend who were bi with her permission ofc and would get back to her with their opinion etc i am straight at least a of now and i realise i don t have the capability to understand how it must feel to not know a part of your identity but i try to be empathetic and do a much a i can to help her in any way that i could okay now on to the situation at hand we got together in april and university broke for summer holiday early may she went back home and i stayed back for work we were determined to get through 3 month of this monstrosity together we talked almost every night over call throughout summer until the next semester started in august it wa hard but it wa beautiful towards the end of june she had told me she is going to have a girl night at her place with 3 of her other friend all of them have grown up together and known each other since they were 5 and they are going to be drinking and chilling together the next night during one of the usual conversation she told me that on the previous night after everyone got drunk there wa a point when it wa only her and one of her friend in the room the thing is this friend of hers is in her senior year in high school and ha been seeing a guy for over 2 year now and she also know how this is g s first relationship and how happy both of u are in this relationship anyway both of them know they are confused about whether they are bi or not and they had talked about it multiple time so when they were alone this friend suggests that they should kiss to figure out if they are bi now this is the fucked up part g told me that she hasn t given her friend an answer yet and wanted to talk to me about it first it wa a little shocking at first but i saw how matured this wa and thanked her for deciding to talk about it first spent the next 3 hour discussing what we could do i told her about my view if you kiss someone else when we are in a monogamous relationship i consider that cheating i had told her this in the beginning too i didn t understand if kissing wa the only way to figure it out and just seemed like her friend wa manipulating her in the moment because i didn t know how it wa to be in her situation i proposed the idea of taking a break if she want to go ahead with this proposal and also told her that i would reach out to my close friend who are openly bi and think about this she broke down because she couldn t bear the thought of having to take a break and she said it would hurt me a lot even if we did that we had that conversation and she said that she ha decided to not take the friend up on the proposal a she value this relationship that wa the end of that fast forward to day before yesterday when she tell me she ha been hiding some thing because she know how much i would be hurt and go on to tell me that she had kissed the friend when she asked that night and she wanted to tell me the next night but got scared by how much it would affect me it wa a lot to process and all i could do in the moment is cry i felt like i had been hit by a meteor i never even thought that she would cheat on me amp x200b anyway this is getting too long now i have been thinking about this for the last 2 day and here are the point of consideration 1 what hurt me the most is that she kissed someone else she could come that close to someone and couldn t think of me which would have stopped her from doing it she claim that thought came but she thought i would be le hurt if she just did it and told me later because in the moment she truly believed that she had to kiss to figure out and she wa trying to keep it to herself this long mostly because she wa trying to forget it happened and just go on with the good relationship 2 however what concern me the most is the thinking what lead to that moment what justification she gave to herself to do it what kept her from telling me for 5 month that is 71 of our time together she ha been lying to me 3 i have told her that i will need my answer in point 2 and when i am satisfied we will see what happens next she is going to see her counsellor and work on her thing and at least try to come up with what she wa thinking and what kept her from telling me i want this relationship to continue we love each other a lot and understand each other well however i do not want to forgive her prematurely without clearing everything on my mind because that is the recipe for a toxic relationship i will keep asking her question until i am satisfied particularly after having fixed the insecurity this just came a a huge hit on that i don t want to go back to that insecure version of myself amp x200b what i am asking everyone here is if i am doing the right thing now am i being naive trying to be understanding here how do i truly forgive her and move on how do i not let the insecurity creep back in how do i stop picturing that girl kissing my gf every time i look at her lip how do i be sure she wouldn t keep something else of similar gravity to herself again to avoid a fight how do i rebuild the trust we had after this major breach how do i truly forgive her would my relationship ever go back to how amazing it wa before this are there people here who forgave their so after they cheated on them and have been able to really move on amp x200b tl dr i don t know how to deal with gf kissing her friend who asked her to kiss to figure out if they are bi when they were drunk and i m hurt because she deliberately lied to me for 71 5 mo of the length of our relatively new relationship,0
my 33m wife 31f of 1 year admitted she settled for me should i stay sorry for any grammatical error english is not my first language i should start off by saying that i love my wife to death we ve been together 5 year and i would truly do anything for her however i ve always felt like i put much more into the relationship than she doe date sex affection money etc and whenever i tried to talk with her about she d say that she wa just comfortable and that it wa acceptable since i m the man i grew up in a conservative household and this sentiment didn t exactly stray very far from what i wa taught a a boy so i just dealt with it to paint a better picture my wife never initiate sex never pay for date doesn t initiate much affection never compliment me and doesn t really buy me gift now i m no adonis i am an average guy who is in relatively good shape with average feature but it still would be nice to feel like an adonis from time to time especially from your own wife a i ve been doing a lot of reflecting the past couple month i ve realized how much this actually bother me well it eventually culminated in me sitting my wife down and explaining to her that i do not feel attractive wanted and i wanted to know why she won t put in much effort into our relationship she tried to explain it off with her usual excuse but it didn t sit right with me so pushed further and kept persisting after a while of badgering she broke and finally admitted she settled for me when choosing a partner she said that the reason she picked me wa that i seemed like nice man with a stable job who could ve been a good husband she also admitted that she never found me particularly physically attractive but emotionally we clicked a she wa sitting there explaining this to me i felt very hurt and even used i couldn t believe my own wife did not find me attractive when she finished i told her that i had to leave and went to have a few drink on my own i haven t spoken much to my wife in day my heart and my head are still in shock i suppose and i am still very angry the thing is i still love my wife and want her to be happy she s a good woman at heart and i hate to see her hurt but i don t want to have a relationship where i feel unwanted tl dr felt unwanted in relationship spoke to my wife wife say she settled for me and i m having mixed feeling,0
my 20 f sister 25 f made out with my crush 20 m at a party this past weekend just a few day after i had told her that i like him and want to ask him out first of all i just want to say that i know we can t claim people if my crush happens to prefer her that s great for them and i sincerely wish them the best i mean that but from one sister to another what she did really caught me off guard my crush is someone that i ve known since high school i didn t have a crush on him back then only about a few month back did i start to look at him differently before that we were both in different relationship and dating other people so the thought of being with him had never really occurred to me but we grew really over the summer and maintained that closeness in the month after my plan wa to ask him out at the party but before that i spoke to my sister about it day before i told her that i have a crush on that one friend and she wa very surprised to hear it because apparently he just doesn t seem like my type whatever that mean but also excited for me when the party finally rolled around i saw him there and we talked for a bit he told me that i looked really nice and just it seemed like thing were getting off to a good start but then more people arrived including my sister and we both got a little distracted talking to everyone else by the time i remembered what i had set out to do at that party i couldn t find my crush anymore i asked one of our other friend if my crush had left and they said that they saw him outside of the house it wa a cold night so it didn t make sense that he would be outside but i didn t read too deep into it after a few minute i ducked out of the house in search of him and found him on the front porch kissing my older sister at first i thought i wa imagining thing but it wa definitely them obviously he s allowed to do whatever he want he s not my boyfriend and he wa unaware of the crush that i had and still sort of have on him but my sister knew and she drove there that night so she wasn t drinking to the point of doing something like that without realizing i immediately felt sick and took off through the side door on my own walked home etc my sister ha been trying to contact me ever since no word from my crush i honestly don t know how to feel about what happened i want to be easygoing and just brush it off like it wa nothing but it wasn t nothing it wa really fucked up of her to do that knowing that i had crush on him and that i wa at the same party if she wa interested in him a well then she should have given me a head up instead she wa excited for me and talked to me for hour about how to word my feeling when i finally do ask him out then she went and kissed him a few day later that make no sense i m deeply upset and confused i would never do something like this to her we re going to have to see each other at christmas within the next couple of week i really don t know what to say to her or how to act going by the number of time she ha called me since the party she know that i saw what happened i ve not answered a single one of her call but because i m going to have to see her at christmas in a couple of week i figure i should get my thought in order before that happens am i overreacting how am i supposed to trust her or interact with her normally after something so egregious tl dr although i have no claim over him it s still really upsetting to me that my sister would go and kiss the one guy that she know i like she ha been trying to contact me ever since but i have been ignoring her call because i don t know what to say i m going to have to see her at christmas how do i navigate that situation am i overreacting if she liked him a well she could have just told me ahead of time,0

ll never tell you just how much control you have over me because i never wanted you to be able to take everything i had in me but you did your cruelty ha shattered the piece of me i gave you to protect i thought they were safe within you i told you everything my hope my fear my vulnerability my demon and oh my demon how you fed them made them so much stronger against my already fragility and you gave them back to me left me to deal with them alone surely i wa always your friend before i wa your wife i have said all this to you but it ha fallen on deaf ear whether it s ignorance denial or just not caring i m not sure i don t even know that it would be any easier to know which one it is i haven t been enough for anyone including myself for month still even after all of this i want to make you happy i shouldn t have to change me to make you happy though i shouldn t have to change any part of me even the part of me that you hate see even the part of you that have ripped me to shred i still love those part of you because they re part of you but how could all this be how could we go from promise of unconditional undying love to me needing to walk away to save myself maybe you think i m just being selfish and that s okay you can think that i m being selfish so that i can be loving and patient again not the broken mess i am i already know that you ll try to manipulate other people s perception of me and that s okay i just pray to god you know what you re doing that you re choosing carefully about what you say you made our life together very public and i didn t mind i wa happy for people to know that i wa with you but now i m just left wondering about so much and those question suck to think about but don t worry i ll let it go like i normally do i ll do my best to accept that i ll never get answer from you you must feel so good about yourself you must love to be able to tell people that you supported me and i walked away manipulating into say that i only have the strength i have because of you leaving out the bit of hurt that you caused too expressing them to you every single time wa setting myself on fire again to keep you warm to see my pain it must have stroked your ego to see me completely fall apart for you even now with all my hurt all my confusion all of my being i want to send this to you but i know i won t because i know that it will please you to see how much i am really crashing inside you would pick me up just to be set back on the shelf until the next time that you decide you want to get off on watching me cry you ve taken everything i have said from such a negative way and that s been really hard for me getting defensive because of how i felt so in turn i felt guilty and i started building my wall up it break my heart to feel like i needed to do that with you you used to let me be unapologetically me you used to breathe the very life into me that i now breathe but with every defensive stance you took you sucked it right back out it s okay though it really truly is i know you were hurting at the same time even a much a i have hurt and told you for month how different you were you stood firm telling me i have stood by and supported you like your support wa a weapon to be used to have power over me it wasn t given freely it wa given to me so you could feel in control that s not fair you re so selfish giving only tidbit here and there to try to keep control of me i hope you re proud of yourself but also i m sad for you i m sad that you are so insecure with yourself that you need to find someone to tear apart to try and fulfill yourself with the broken piece of them that you caused and then when they have nothing left to give you you discard them like the trash that you treated them a one day someone will destroy you the way that you have destroyed others people will see you for who you are and you will be left to deal with your demon on your own i hope you survive i hope one day you can love yourself so that you are able to genuinely love someone else and know what it feel like,1

i broke no contact with my ex now i regret it and don t know what to say i left my emotionally abusive ex around 2 month ago i have my own apartment now and am slowly starting to put myself back together after a year of pain i originally went no contact with him so i could help my healing process i ignored all of his attempt to contact me however around a week ago he sent me an email begging me to speak to him this time i responded to his email and basically ripped into him i typed out everything awful he did and said to me and told him how awful and worthless he made me feel in a way it wa somewhat cathartic and helped me release some of my pent up anger against him the problem is that now he keep sending me all of these apology and saying how he understands that the way he wa is a huge problem and he s willing to work on everything he is acknowledging all of his terrible behavior and saying that he is willing to be better towards me i don t believe him though i feel like he is trying to manipulate me like he did before when i wa still with him i can t help but think that his apology is not sincere i feel like he is trying to rope me back into his life so i need to stop engaging with him i guess the issue i have now is that i am starting to feel guilty that i am not trying to make it work i feel bad for giving up on him even though i know i shouldn t my anxiety is starting to spike and i feel awful for not believing his apology part of me want to go no contact again but now i feel all of these terrible emotion and feel like i should keep talking to him even though i know it s not good for me i desperately want to believe in him but my gut is telling me it s all just a ploy to get my back i dunno i guess i just need help and support i have no idea how to stay no contact when i really want to believe him i apologize for the rant i m just feeling very stressed and overwhelmed by his bombarding anyone else go through the same thing,1

i don t know whether this is appropriate or not i ve lost the ability to judge sorry i ve started and stopped writing this so many time i ve done my best to stop it being a rant i m sure i m just being an idiot but i m planning on getting through christmas with my oh but i think after that i need to leave we have two kid 9 amp 13 and i tried to leave a few year back i wish i had i would be in a better place now i think it s like every time i get something sorted to please him he move the goal post so i ve found the dining room table for christmas dinner i do this every this time of year and now our bedroom is apparently a mess this is a new one on me it feel like once i deal with one thing he find another to beat me about we both work full time so i don t have much time to think about this kind of stuff we don t have a cleaner or grocery delivered both of which would really help me because he doesn t like people visiting the house in term of everything i feel i am the default position and i am the main childcare provider in term of finance he refused a joint account we are married but doe pay the mortgage and the majority of bill i instead pay for all christmas and birthday present phone internet clothes after school activity petrol incidental and half the holiday oh and i bought the car and whilst he buy the food i probably spend half a much again picking up the stuff he doesn t buy because he doesn t approve or i didn t put it on the list it s common sense milk running low buy it see i am ranting and i m also in a reasonable position financially because i work it hasn t always been this way so when we first had kid i wa working but constantly hiding an overdraft my hard work ha eventually paid off i do appreciate that i am lucky in this and just working hard doesn t always work out so well for everyone but the worst is we have a dead bedroom he will pester me every now and then i am a recovering mainly sober alcoholic and i will deliberately get drunk leave work early to satisfy him and get it done with i then detox during this whole process he doesn t kiss me hold me or even thank me afterwards i m not sure why i expect thanks except i have gone out of my way to basically service him i m sorry i should have probably put this on offmychest or not sounded like such an arse a i probably do i m basically a mess and i suspect it s my own fault i just have no perspective any more,1
my 31 f cousin 31 f who is wa my best friend in the world will not stop being awful to me ever since we both had baby i unknowingly smoked weed during much of my pregnancy and had a healthy child while hers ended up with severe disability i m pretty sure she hate me hello relationship throwaway account i posted about this before but didn t get any feedback here is the story me and my cousin have been best friend forever we were born 3 day apart and were inseparable until about 3 year ago me and my husband 31 m started trying for a baby a few year ago up until then we were heavy pot smoker we are both accountant with great job and weren t typical lazy stoner but i ll be honest we smoked a lot we both came home from work and smoked and smoked on the weekend sometimes all day don t judge me please lol we ve since stopped anyway we both stopped smoking when we started trying for a baby we tried for almost 2 year to no avail but we weren t in a rush and decided we were kind of on the fence anyway so we went back on birth control and back to smoking not a heavily but still daily so we are living life working our job smoking and hanging with friend thank god i don t drink and one day i fell over in horrendous pain my husband rushed me to the hospital where they informed me that i had a kidney stone ouch and that i wa pregnant it turn out i wa 20 week pregnant i had gained about 10 pound but i m skinny and it wasn t too noticeable kind of a food baby so i thought i never had any symptom or anything this is important i wa on birth control that made my period go away there wa absolutely no reason for me to suspect i wa pregnant so i immediately stopped smoking weed and started freaking tf out that i had destroyed the fetus with marijuana i spent day on google researching to see what sort of damage i had done i couldn t really find much research and the doctor said the pregnancy wa a perfectly healthy one and he wa right our baby wa born a healthy a a horse i know i messed up but i swear to god if i had known i wa pregnant i would have never smoked weed or anything for that matter now at the same time i wa pregnant my cousin got pregnant she and her husband 32 m had been planning like crazy and she wa taking all kind of supplement and eating incredibly healthy to make sure her pregnancy wa perfect her and her husband were the only people who knew i had smoked weed throughout half my pregnancy they knew i wa unaware and were totally non judgmental about it it even became a little inside joke between the 4 of u i know i know so bad anyway about 3 month after my kid wa born hers wa unfortunately something went horribly wrong during her child s birth and he wa left severely disabled he will never speak or walk or use the toilet or eat without a tube it s really bad once her child wa born she instantly started to resent me she would say passive aggressive thing to me all the time and once she even posted on twitter that i didn t deserve a healthy baby and she did honestly she s not wrong so i ignored it and kept my distance she deleted it rather quickly i don t have twitter but i had like 3 family member send me the screenshot after a couple of month she came back around and thing were a good a they could be but still really rocky i have seen her and her husband struggle i know how difficult their life is i have helped babysit and

ridiculously good care of herself while pregnant and her child wa born with severe disability the problem occurred during birth he wa healthy until birth now she hate me for having a healthy kid despite my pot use,0
being intentionally cruel to your sexual need is abuse too i want to clarify dissenting from sex is always a choice however i ve experienced a very different variation of this behavior that wa done entirely with cruel intent sometimes a partner will demand you please them sexually and intentionally deny your need and neglect you simply to be cold or selfish i had an ex that insisted on certain act but refused to return them wa demeaning a if i owed him sexual favor hed never give back and whenever i pleaded with him for the simplest of thing hed yell at me that woman don t have need and i exist to please him and i m just being a cry baby for expecting anything more if your partner intentionally starves you of your sexual need and humiliates you for having them that s abuse the important part is it is done to be selfish and cruel to you and no other real reason ideally your sexual behavior should be to want to be kind to each other and make each other feel loved in all the way you each need to be if you simply have different preference that is not cruel but to intentionally make your partner be deprived of their sexual need can be abuse too they know you need this and they are starving you from it a a form of psychological harm,1
he left me after two and a half week of dating because i didn t want to have sex with other woman for his own pleasure because i don t like it when he hit me because i don t feel comfortable with his ridiculous sexual demand because i can t handle rough sex sometimes because i didn t have insurance to drive him to place because i put my foot down and set some boundary because he realized i wasn t his object,1
i think i m turning into him i wa in an abusive marriage i wa 18 he wa 28 it lasted 8 year i didn t want to be with him but both family pressured me and before i knew it i wa living in another state away from all my friend and family and everything i knew i wa pregnant and scared my parent said tough when i begged them to come home said it would get better and i wa just over reacting it didn t get better i lost who i wa he manipulated me into thinking i wa awful at everything i wa scared to talk to new people my self esteem wa the lowest it could possibly be but from the outside he made it seem like we were so happy and he wa the most amazing husband to me fast forward i m now 35 and just celebrated my one year anniversary my husband now is the most amazing human being i ve ever met he make me feel beautiful and always tell me how he think i m the most amazing mother i can t escape my ex tho i find myself arguing with my now husband just like my ex used to with me i have said the exact same thing my ex used to always say to me to my current husband and whenever i get made it s like i m in another world i know my anger is all bottled up from my ex but i have been taking all the hurt out on my now husband and i m so scared i m going to be an abuser just like my ex i have so much rage and resentment towards my ex for taking away all those year and now for some reason i don t feel like i deserve my husband now and it s like i m trying to push him away i m doing the exact same thing my ex did to me to my current husband,1
my 29f boyfriend 31m cheated on me for the first time decided to give him a chance but now he s more insecure and want me to reassure him that we re okay and that i still love him oof well for some background we ve been together monogamously for over 6 month now with a lot of ups and down we both have a lot of baggage and have been working on ourselves and on the relationship we re both in therapy and doing will be starting couple therapy next month what happened he wa on his way to another state for work and had taken an exit impulsively to get sexually pleasured by a man pleasure another man no one he knew just a stranger ended up giving receiving a hand job and continued on his way however the truck started having mechanical issue so he had to turn around and come back picked him up at work and about a few hour after he s been home he told me about it i wa in shock but not really surprised so i reacted very logically i wasn t cruel but i wasn t nice either i guess you could say i wa disassociated disconnected now he s talked about him having interest in men sexually before this i myself am extremely open minded and supportive of different sexuality identity he however is deeply ashamed of it and ha suppressed it since he wa 9 he ha acted on it numerous time throughout his life though but would always be ashamed from what he told me i had told him that it s okay to be open with me that i would never judge or condone him for it he always told me if he ever got the urge to be intimate with another person he would tell me first obviously he didn t hold himself to that and that s what disappointed me the most however that s been a common theme with him since being in this relationship hence why i wasn t all that surprised i don t trust him but i have hope a naive a that sound that we can get through these toxic behavior a long a we both continue to address them and work to improve ourselves which we seem to be doing so i didn t end it but he s aware if it happens again i m out he s already told his therapist and sponsor and is taking an active step in addressing the issue my dilemma we had a talk tonight after a few day of sitting on what happened i told him i wa angry angry because he destroyed what little trust i had in his word and angry because i understood his impulsiveness but didn t at the same time i explained to him that his action have not been a reflection of his word that he quite literally go against what he say value in the most fundamentally important way basically calling him out on his hypocrisy in the most kindest way possible i told him i don t trust anything he say even his i love you s i told him that it s okay to be sexually attracted to men and have sexual desire for the same sex hell it s okay to have desire to have sex with someone the opposite sex a well it s acting on it and not being truthful and talking about it with the person you promised to be monogamous with first that make it wrong he listened and wa respectful and validated my emotion and apologized i explained to him that i understood he need to explore his sexuality to get over the shame and that it may mean being okay with him exploring it with another person with some boundary but that i really needed to think about it to make sure that i am totally okay with it meaning i needed to be sure that it s not going to be something that i ll end up resenting or regretting later we talked a tad bit more in detail about the possibility and my concern and then he wanted to have a full make out session i told him i wasn t really in the mood that i wa full from dinner i needed to brush my teeth and i felt dirty from cleaning the apartment then followed up with because he wa about to ask for reassurance it doesn t mean i don t love you and it doesn t mean i don t want to be with you he then asked if i still love him want to be with him wa in love with him wa happy with him i just kind of snapped there i explained to him that i didn t feel like i should be reassuring him because of what he did told him it felt like i wa walking a fine line between enabling his behavior being a doormat and setting boundary and i wasn t entirely sure where the reassurance lay in that line he took it a me invalidating his emotion and implying that he s not allowed to be insecure he said when he asks those question it s not to get a pas it s because he need reassurance for his insecurity which is nothing new he asks those question somewhat on a daily basis i apologized for being harsh and he apologized for getting a bit defensive and the rest of the night wa good tl dr because boyfriend cheated on me i feel like he s relinquished the right to ask for reassurance regarding the relationship and how i feel after what he did what do you think am i being too cold and insensitive part of me feel guilty for feeling that way because not giving reassurance is hurtful invalidates and give him more ammo for his insecure thought to fester despite what he did he s still a human being with feeling and i do still love him and care about him is there a way to give him reassurance without me feeling like i m a doormat suggestion thought sorry for the long winded post i appreciate the time you took to read it,0
how doe an abusive partner react if they re directly called out on being abusive first off this isn t a typical threat while i have been in an abusive relationship over 3 year back this is not what it s about i m writing a screenplay in which a girl confronts her abusive ex boyfriend trying to blackmail her into a relationship she flat out call their relationship abusive and i m not sure how to write that scene how doe an abuser react when faced with something like this my ex probably wouldn t have cared but she had also come to term with being a terrible person and decided that she wa cool with it and now look at our past relationship with nothing but disdain this is a bit of a different situation the girl is the one who disdain the relationship the guy doe genuinely think they had some good time together and that deep down the girl doe still want to be with him a these controlling a hole do her dismissing all the good time they ve had a abusive doe anyone here have a similar experience how do you think he d react i want the guy s reaction to be genuine and reflect reality so i figured i d need to do a bit of research on the topic and sadly my own life experience doesn t cut it i apologize if this thread doesn t fit the topic and i hope i m not being offensive by asking asking question about a sensitive part of your life feel free to delete it if it doesn t work i just don t really know where else to ask,1

how do i 23f thank my boyfriend 25m for saving my life one of my hobby that i really enjoy is paddleboarding basically where you stand on a board and paddle along the water there is a river near my home that i regularly go paddleboarding on at the beginning of last year my boyfriend bought me a present an expensive inflatable life jacket which you basically wear and if you need it you pull a cord and it inflates into a life jacket at first i actually laughed i thought it wa so silly after all i have a cord that attache me to the board and the board is obviously a giant float i told him it wa thoughtful but that he should return it because of how much money it cost him he refused and made me promise to wear it when i went paddleboarding this last weekend i decided to go out one last time before the cold weather really set in it wa a bit chilly so i wa wearing regular clothes instead of my normal bathing suit i don t know if it wa the wind or recent rain but after about 30 minute i lost my footing which never really happens and went into the river the cord attached to my foot flew off and although i tried to swim to it the board wa moving much too quickly in the current for me to get to between the cold water my clothing and the wind i quickly started to struggle to stay afloat i tried not to panic when i remembered the inflatable life jacket my boyfriend made me wear i pulled the emergency cord and it quickly inflated into a life jacket and i wa able to stay afloat without issue it still took me nearly 30 minute to slowly make my way back to shore now i feel so bad for laughing at him last year i know that i wouldn t be here right now had he not bought me that present and made me promise to wear it i don t know how to thank him i m still so shaken up over it any idea tl dr i love being on the water last year my boyfriend bought me a very expensive life jacket and made me promise to wear it i laughed at first but this past weekend it saved my life after a mishap on the water how do i thank him for that,0

a youtuber who us his power and position on the platform to make lie defamation say my personal private information and call people to stalk and harsss me people dont know about the abuse i went through because he make me seem like i wa just an obsessed crush when i have screenshot evidence he called himself my boyfriend on many an occasion he even broke up with me and got back together with

delete twitter which wa my main source of income a an artist my reputation is being tarnished and i m falling apart every day with panic attack and flash back of his abuse and the worst part is my self esteem is so bad i can t help but apologize for everything i do cuz he made me feel like i m just too sensitive and stuff he even got mad at me whenever i said stuff about toxic behavior and gas lighting told me it wa tumblr language and made himself the victim even if i wa the one being abused i lost a lot of innocence to him and he wa very sex addicted with me he d even publicly humiliate me or treat me like i m dumb so i started believing it cuz his friend all laughed along and i felt helpless or like i wa being a party killer if i objected i wa put on a pedestal and then told in the worst and i m horrible and an emotional black hole i even have severe childhood ptsd and he d get mad at me for having panci attack so i d repress them until i got suicidal a couple time i wa manipulated torn down violated verbally abused and cheated on i ve lost any self esteem and i get so many panic attack at one point he even would show me movie with rape and sexual abuse and said he liked hearing my reaction there were thing that felt wrong but i d always be told i m too sensitive if i ever wanted space or anything get very angry and threaten me or send his friend to do so it just it broke me down over time and he d dangle how much i hurt him by breaking up with him but then would flirt with me and keep this cycle going and retract support and affection unless we were dating then got with me cuz i d do certain sexual rps he wanted this cycle lasted from october to april until he said we were in an open relationship but not dating and had to hide it and then this lasted until i finally said i m done last month heed flirt with girl i d hear how he d ask if a girl wa single or hint at her wanting to be single a say after talking to her and i d have to smile and joke and laugh and hide the pain hide the pain the guy i stayed up with while he wa in the hospital dumped me then came back after he got rejected by a girl and slowly overtime the spark died and the i love yous and affection and long talms grew le it wa always in limbo it wa always to message me about evidence he wanted i became a burden unless we did sexual roleplay he s dangle it in my face in skype call he straight up would tell me this girl could give you a run for your money or how i don t have to worry and it stabbed me every time in the heart and i d be cry on the other end silently and giggling and pretending this wa ok and normal he made people think i wa just a person with an obsessive crush not someone who wa dating him it hurt every time but to everyone i m not the person he hid a relationship with i m that lying ugly insane whore who he say is crazy and they just believe blindly he had a friend say a rape joke then laughed at me when i explained how rape joke affect survivor on a live stream and even said he wanted to molest me a a flirt he d even tell me who i wa allowed to talk to and stuff my therapist said he s basically a creepy pedophilic man trying to follow the law cuz i look and sound young but i m legal he fed off my naivete and innocence and it wa about a dominance and using the fact he s older to make me trust him and what he ha to say i m the youngest person he s ever dated all his other ex s were in their 20 and we started dating after i just turned 19 he even flirted with his ex a girl he dated after we broke up the first time who he knew dated him to use him and strung him along before we dated the second time a punishment for when i pissed him off and taught me it wa normal and ok and that i deserved it and now i live with year of emotional scar my friend and a couple others during all of this sat me in a 4 hour call maybe 5 and tried to get me away from him but like an abuse victim i defended his action because of the gas lighting i had him whispering in my ear don t listen and i listened to him instead i trusted him i loved him he love me right well be ok right well it ll get better right well he won t get mad at me if i behave right well i m a bad person well i don t deserve him well i i blamed myself i listened to all of the venom he dripped disguised a honey i only do this because i love you until the i love yous stopped and then it became flirting sexual roleplay constantly constant put down emotional beating after emotional beating it all your fault but i love you but you better not leave me this pattern lasted an entire year until i became nothing but in my friend word a walking apology apologizing for existing needing human need like food and support and break and a person to talk to apologizing for feeling emotion because i wasn t used to not being told how to feel i kept telling myself it ll get better but it never did slowly the boiling water consumed the frog until i wa a shell don t know who i am if i m allowed to say certain thing if i m even deserving of love that s what that kind of manipulation doe to you it make you wonder how good a person you are how deserving you are until one day you think you deserve the pain then he did this thing where he d flirt act like he wanted to get back with me then say he can t handle it and would scream at me how it s never enough for me it drove me to attempt suicide and i justi felt trapped and scared but also like i deserved to suffer because i wa so used to feeling like i wa a burden constantly being told i m selfish it s all one sided how i m too sensnitive cuz i d ask him to not make r pe joke around me cuz of my sexual abuse trauma he even got pissed at me for having panic attack so i learned to feel shame for them i felt contantly in fear or walking on eggshell throughout the relationship and the worst part is he constantly cheated on me but i had to live with it because i deserved it for hurting him last year that s what he told me he even broke up with me right when he got out of the hospital after i stayed up all night with him for hour and hour while he wa sick with a turned intestine then went back to me asking for a secret open relationshop after my friend rejcted him at a convention but he also said he s the victim and i m the back stabbing bitch who ll betray him so i always took the blame even when he hurt me even when he screamed at me and made me cry i ve had nightmare panic attack broken down cry so many time and i can t tell anyone on that side of thing what i ve gone through and he s having people stalk and harass me so i stay silent he s a youtuber with a lot of subscriber then when i finally escaped him he threatened to release my nude he kept them after we broke up and i asked him to delete them and he said i asked him to delete them and he said but grace sent me nude and i didn t keep them think of it a an honor after i cut contact with him i asked his friend to ask to delete them story changed from they re deleted to i can t find them i ve dealt with stalking and harrassment and even told i deserve to die for trying to speak up about my abuse to the past month i m working on this all in therapy ive even been told i deserve to die and such by his friend the skype log are to show how often he had mood swing or would break up and get back with me soon after thank you for listening to my story i can t talk about it anywhere his follower can see they a of filed a false police report on me to terrorize me and my family have released my address and are currently making false accusation about me i took him to court and i m happy to say while his friend can talk about me he can t utter my name ever again the experience of abuse will take a long time in healing with the gas lighting and constantly having to ask permission to do anything i went through i may not have been a child but he certainly had an advantage over me emotionally and mentally with his age and the fact i have autism,1

bank teller won t stop commenting on my appearance 27f 32f i work in a position that requires me to go to the same bank almost every day each week there is one teller that work there cathy that is generally really sweet but pretty chatty and it ha started being problematic for me for reference i had been doing deposit basic transaction there daily for about a year and a half before she started working there when she first started thing at my job were a little bit slower so i had time to talk to her and we became friendly enough talking about work stuff her family etc i m 27 and childless she s 32 and ha a couple kid in general we probably talk longer than a usual teller client conversation just because we re close in age and i like hearing about her life and telling her about mine just to say that we probably have a relationship that is closer to being friend than the usual bank teller client dynamic given that i m there almost every day due to my job it wa really nice having a friendly face to come to until recently she is into oil and ha up until now slipped into conversation random advice along the line of oh you have a headache try this infusion pretty innocuous and fine with me but i think it s important to mention in the context of what i m upset about recently she s started going beyond recommending me oil or whatever and commenting directly on my appearance i will try to get my deposit and other transaction i need done with her doing the usual chit chat and she will say that i look tired or like i m just not a pretty a normal followed by question of is there something going on honey maybe you need x oil to help you out with your sleep diet etc so all of that bother me i come to the bank in the middle of the work day and i m always clean professionally dressed get good sleep and i don t really party i work 50 hour week sometimes and on top of that i ve been moving house dealing with medical bill and helping my parent out with stuff i ve already been self conscious about not looking super glow y every day and refreshed a anyone who doesn t have a spare 2 hour per day to dedicate to yoga will testament to i feel perfectly fine in my own skin just not like a beauty queen every day or whatever anyways it ha started really hurting my feeling and becoming a daily downer i will feel fine and energized and pretty until she comment that i look haggard that wa the most recent comment or some other comment that make me question my entire appearance no one else seems to say i look like shit but every day after i visit the bank without fail i feel like crap because she say something negative about my appearance i tried to deflect it a few time by saying oh yeah i m tired i m in the middle of moving house or this ha been a crazy work week but it doesn t seem to stop her from what i feel are inappropriate comment i also feel like i shouldn t have to justify my appearance to this person it s exhausting and no one else in my life ha said anything my boyfriend coworkers and family regularly say that i look fine beyond that i still think it is definitely not her place from a professional stand point to be commenting on anything regarding my appearance i m sick of her recommending different weird oil to me to help with my sleep cycle and diet and everything else i ve ignored her comment and i ve started just trying to come to the bank at different time but she is there during my work hour and she always call me up first i am fond of her even if it seems like she ha no boundary i don t feel like it s professional for her to say anything to me i am essentially her client and i would never comment on a client s appearance if i were in her shoe is there anything else i can do to de escalate the situation or is this just a particularly tough skin i have to develop amp x200b tl dr bank teller is consistently making negative comment about my appearance i can t tell if she s being petty sincere or it s professionally acceptable how should i navigate,0

i m41 no longer love my wife f42 should i tell her or continue a we are for the kid sake tl dr i m afraid telling my wife i no longer love her would destroy my family while achieving nothing i ve been with my wife for 20 year now with 12 those being married to her we have three healthy and beautiful kid below the age of 11 and if we re not rolling in money we re not sinking either and there s a chance it will improve soon what i guess i m saying is that our life is a hella lot better than what some folk have the issue is that i ve come to realize that i no longer love my wife i ll be honest and say it wa never a big romance to begin with we drifted together at college and were both each other s first and only sexual partner she s conservative so that meant something to her i lacked self confidence so that mean something to me with the exception of one month long blip a long time back i kissed someone else and confessed it we ve never broken up we ve just kind of coasted along without thinking very much about u at all this didn t bother me so much when i wa younger a i wa working hard on getting professionally established but in the last few year i ve found it harder and harder to have any positive feeling about my wife i don t hate her i just feel that our relationship is like a piece of gum that ha all the flavor chewed out of it i know everything she ll say before she say it when i meet people socially i prefer to do so alone a it mean the evening won t fall into the same pre worn groove it always doe she s religious i m not so there s no point bringing up the issue of the day because it end up in pointless blue v red bickering on the other hand my wife is a fantastic mother and i d jump on the grenade in a heartbeat if it meant she d survive to bring up our kid i guess i should also say that i find myself drinking more and more on my own in the evening though i m not sure i m ready to have this classed a problem drinking a i discharge my responsibility just fine my question is should i say any of this to my wife my priority is my child and i m prepared to tough out whatever it take to ensure they grow up in a safe predictable environment we moved to a different state on account of my job and she often say she s like to return to our very conservative city of origin if i tell her that i think our marriage is on the rock and i quite certain that she d return there with the kid i would simply be a juda who broke his promise to his family and no rational discussion would be possible she s also highly anxious and this would upend her world in way it make me sick to think about from my side i do not think i could be happy in any subsequent life that made my child s welfare worse in short i feel that saying i no longer love her is just a selfish move that would blow up everything to no good end and everyone s disadvantage what should i do,0
hoovering and stalking so i am friend with a guy who is kind of manipulative i think not quite a boyfriend girlfriend kind of relationship though he is starting to act like it is and really manipulative he threatened suicide so i called the cop and cop came to his house and he said he wasn t suicidal and said i betrayed him so many time i don t know why i am such an idiot trying to give him chance and trust him again when time and time again he ha caused me immense anxiety and distress for example recently i went out with him he wanted to use my phone to install some apps for me which were supposedly helpful using some kind of storage device so stupidly i wa sucked in and pressured and i caved in so i let him use my phone to install stuff but then i seemed very anxious and he kind of picked up on my emotion and kept questioning me i did a factory reset and checked that my phone wasn t rooted every now and then he will text me either for advice or giving advice when i post on chat group that we share i seem to be more outgoing and doing better than some of the mental health patient so perhaps i am an easy target that s his hoovering tactic worse still i gave him my address long ago before i started seeing his true colour we were drinking and he wa afraid that i would get drunk and he needed to call a cab for me if i see someone looking like him loitering near my house i will take legal action but i notice that if i block him on sm chat messaging platform he is more likely to try to track me down in real life i told him the church which i go to because i am not afraid of him coming to church but with workplace i am more secretive and i feel like he is trying to dig information out from me he give a lot of advice and is very concerned about his friend and will check up on them he say a lot of people are spreading rumour about him i seem to be holding up better than others in his opinion i don t know why he is using such tactic on me compared to the people who seem to be doing worse like i am financially better off and i seem more coherent and more functional and le decompensated but that s no excuse for his abusive behaviour,1
i m in an extremely mentally abusive relationship and i know it but i don t know how to leave it back in september i started seeing one of my coworkers he wa extremely sweet the first couple of week cooked for me planned sweet date took interest in my interest the whole nine yard i stopped seeing other guy when i realized i wanted to be with him which is big for me because i don t get into relationship easily we started getting fairly serious and then he started acting different one day we just started fighting over everything what i posted on facebook how i looked at our coworkers what i wa doing when i didn t answer his call it wa insane and i wa done i refused to date a guy i wa already fighting with a month into being together we started to ease up on seeing each other and then one morning i woke up and i just knew i wa pregnant straight after work i went over to see my best friend and we huddled in her work bathroom only to take a test that wa only a confirmation of what i already knew clear blue doesn t fuck around in big bold letter they let you know you fucked up i called him when he got off work and told him that we needed to talk when i got to his house i sat down next to him and handed him the pregnancy test he didn t even have to read it enclosed in the wrapper and all he also knew we had already discussed before hand that if i were to ever get pregnant i would have an abortion no question about it but he still told me whatever you want to do i will support you at that time i wa so grateful that out of anybody this wa happening with it wa him with that being said though i m 21 year old i can barely afford my rent let alone a kid and he s 27 with a kid and is barely past me in life the decision wa already made i went in for the abortion which he kindly paid for only to find out that they couldn t find the fetus the doctor wasn t sure on whether the pregnancy wa too early or ectopic either way no abortion that day after a week of testing my hormone level it wa thankfully determined that i wa just too early due to a busy schedule i wasn t able to have the procedure for three more week and i hate to say it but three more week killed me pregnancy wa not good on me i couldn t eat every time i did i would vomit the whole time i wasn t vomiting i wa nauseous the only time i wasn t nauseous wa the 12 hour a day i wa sleeping all while still gaining ten pound in three week still having to work and continue living my life like nothing wa going on the guy i wa seeing started acting different again he wasn t answering my call would start fight with me at work and kept avoiding seeing me it didn t really affect me until the weekend before my abortion i had an extra three week to think about everything to experience pregnancy and while i hated it i wa still in need of comfort in what all wa happening i kept calling him the whole weekend he either didn t answer or his phone wa turned off i spent all weekend in bed cry by myself monday morning come the morning of the procedure and he blow my phone up call me 30 time texting me about how he wanted to go telling me to answer his call all of it i don t know if it wa the right thing but i ignored him i went into the procedure with my best friend waiting for me in the office only for one of the worst thing to ever happen to me get even worse the medication didn t work and then the procedure went wrong a simple procedure from what i ve read ended up being the absolutely most excruciating thing i have ever experienced i couldn t talk for about three hour i didn t even know how to process the pain i had experienced even after it wa over i don t know what i expected but i called him and he didn t answer when we finally did talk i wa so angry and he seemed unapologetic we stopped talking a much after that week i couldn t do anything i couldn t get out of bed or get ready for work i cried every night and stopped going out with friend i tried to go out with other guy but i wa so disgusted in myself i couldn t bare the touch of someone else i then found out he wa speaking to his daughter mother again after he called me one day and told me i flipped out i wa so angry at everything that i wa going through only to find out he wa fine that he had been talking to her while i had been experiencing the hardest time of my life a time that i had originally thought he would help get me through but every time i said he didn t care he would start yelling at me about being insensitive towards his emotion and i don t know how he feel he stopped talking to her and we ended up talking again we still fight every day he accuses me of doing stuff that i m not and he won t leave me alone every time i address a problem between u he make up something that he think i did to excuse something he did and start calling me a hoe and a thot he doe it because every time i don t understand why he can be so mean and i confront him about it he apologizes is nice for two three day and then the situation repeat itself last week i read his message i ve never looked through a guy phone before and i don t think what i did wa okay but i found

im an abuser ive finally come to term with what ive manipulated my own self into believing wasnt true but i am in fact controlling manipulative cruel verbally and emotionally abusive i could sit here and throw a million excuse from childhood to bad relationship a to why im abusive dont pity me either because i dont deserve it i do need help and i do want to change i just dont know where to start i dont even know if i can change im currently in a relationship that ive been in for over a year and a half thing were great a the start to all relationship are i guess there were warning sign that a few thing i wa doing couldve led to something worse and they have they weren t intentional initially she didnt notice them and didnt seem to mind i thought nothing of it either but of course i wouldnt the last few week of 2018 thing got a bit out of hand which rolled right into this year and it only gotten worse since maybe im mentally ill maybe im sadistic i do love her i swear to god i do id die for her and id die if she ever did ive told her countless time myself all throughout the year that im shitty that im no good it a toxic relationship she should get out but of course also being the manipulative person i am i knew how to control my abusiveness just enough to make her see me a a good person but with a troubling past tonight wa a breaking point i suppose she told me everything that she should ve a long time ago i want to change and yet i want to control her just without the whole abusive part which i think is possible because some time during the summer i managed to not manipulate her not force her to do thing not verbally abuse her and for that she did whatever i wanted her to because she actually didnt mind a long a i wa being nice ive thought about killing myself a lot just to have her be rid of me she think she need me but she doesnt shes too good for me and i dont deserve her no ive never physically abused her and never would despite everything that doesnt make me any better because abuse is abuse no matter what form but i just thought that should be said i need help i want help my next best option is taking myself out and having one le asshole in the world if somehow she ever read this i want you to know i am sorry truly i do love you which is why i want to be better for you but if anything please leave me at least until i can get my shit together if i cant then at least you wont have to deal with it anymore,1

i 22f don t like how my husband 28m act when he drink this is a big problem for him my husband and i have been married for a year and a half we didn t live together before getting married i ve never liked his drinking habit we re very incompatible in that regard but we got married anyway at first there wasn t much of an issue in the marriage we just didn t really drink but a the first couple month of marriage went by he started pushing for drinking more it started with 750ml bottle of wine which quickly turned into 1 5l bottle which quickly turned into box if i said i d rather we didn t get any he d get pretty upset we do a pizza and wine night 2 friday a month which involves a box of wine each time a big dent is made in it the first night i d say it s mostly gone by the first night but my husband would probably say it s not i think i m right about that but i feel like i should give both perspective there to get more objective advice at this point my husband seems to think it s kind of ridiculous to ever get a standard bottle of wine he doesn t want to feel like he ha to pay attention to how much he s having which he he d have to do with a standard bottle since he normally drink out of a juice glass and one of those is half the bottle last night we got a 1 5l bottle which i wa opposed to and he know it to go with our steak i had a little le than 1 5 glass over a little le than two hour and we used two small splash for a bit of glaze to put on the steak my husband had the rest of the bottle over the same amount of time save for the two or so sip that are left i feel like this is a lot he think it s basically nothing or at least not a big deal at all i know it sound like i m just really uptight and a killjoy but the thing is i really don t like how he act when he drink more than a glass or two there s a sudden noticable shift in the way he act and talk and it totally ruin the night for me we ll go from talking and connecting and laughing together to him acting annoying and generally unpleasant usually not making a ton of sense and it s such a bummer for me it change the whole tone of the night and it go from feeling like i m connecting with the man i love to feeling like i m interacting with a child i ve never put it like that to him for the record i ve just said i don t really like how he act sometimes when he drink he is really really upset by this he say i m totally overreacting nothing change and that it totally suck for him that i feel that way obviously if i could snap my finger and just change how i feel i would i hate having conflict with him and i hate that drinking is basically ruined for u but i don t like his drunk personality and i don t feel like i can help that to put it bluntly he start acting sounding like he s really stupid and i feel ashamed and embarrassed even when it s just the two of u i hate typing that out because i know it sound really mean and harsh but it s just so unpleasant he s such an intelligent bright man but plenty goofy and silly so it s not like he never get to let that side of him out or anything and i can t stand that shift in him when we re having an otherwise great night together it hurt my feeling that he know how i feel about this but doe it anyway i m the only one he wa hanging out with around last night so shouldn t it matter that i don t like how he get when he ha just a glass too much why would it still be enjoyable for him if his company start having such a bad time i don t get it if he felt the same way about a drug i wa taking like caffeine for example i would definitely make sure to not have any past the point where i start to act differently i wouldn t think twice about it it wouldn t be fun for me anymore if my husband wa having a bad time or starting to not enjoy my company he get to be so unenjoyable to be around and if he felt like that about me after taking a substance i guess i would be sad if i really thought i wa just fun to be around but i would care way more about him not having a good time if we were just hanging out together all i said last night after he asked me what wa wrong wa that i just wished he d drank a little le i left it at that and wasn t trying to start an argument but it really upset him he ended up jokingly saying later that marrying me wa a stupid idea he s since apologized for that but i m still really hurt and he did say after the fact that sometimes some thing do make him feel that way we often have a really nice marriage but we do have our fair share of problem and he s said that my feeling about his drinking is a big one for him i could really use some help and insight for the record the amount he s drinking now is some of the least he s ever been drinking he prefers the hard stuff most of the time and it s been a problem before i ve had private conversation with his mom where she s called him an alcoholic and told me his sibling think the same thing i ve seen his sister comment on how big of a glass he s poured and i ve had a conversation with her and their mom about her concern about his drinking he had so much when we were staying over at their house one night that he smelled terrible all the way into the next night it wa off putting and just really uncomfortable it s also worth noting that he s said some really mean thing to me while drunk before so maybe that contributes to why i don t like his personality when he drink a little too much i don t actually know but i guess it s worth mentioning the bottom line though is that when he ha just a glass too much he start to act differently and it s really unpleasant to me if we re hanging out together i don t see why he d want to do with when it cause a fight almost every time always about how i feel but not necessarily caused by me what can i do how can we move forward i feel like he really crossed a line by saying marrying me wa a stupid idea how can i get over it is he displaying problematic behavior am i tl dr i really don t like my husband s personality when he ha a glass to much to drink this is a big problem for him he s really upset about my feeling about this issue i m not sure how to move forward it seems like we re at a stalemate it usually go the same way he want to get alcohol i don t we do anyway the first couple glass together are enjoyable and just take the edge off then he ha another glass and the way he act really change he hardly see recognizes belief it i go from having a lovely time with him to really not enjoying his company we fight because i wish he d had a little le and he get mad because he wish i didn t feel that way and want to have a much a he want please help me figure this out,0

my 27m wife 25f refuse to let my mom 44f meet our daughter my wife and my mother have a long history of bitterness together they ve never outright done anything to each other but it accumulated when i wa having a disagreement with my mother over something unrelated to my wife and my mother verbally attacked my wife and my wife ended the convo with a rot you old bitch after that stint i went no contact with my mother for two year by choice little by little i began to miss her and want to talk to her so i eventually opened up to my wife and she essentially told me that she would never disallow me to see her however that she won t be doing anything that make her uncomfortable and seeing my mother is one of those i agreed to that for another two year it went on like that when wife got pregnant with our daughter we were so happy but in the same conversation she quieted down and i asked her what wa wrong she looked me in the eye and with one of the most serious tone i have ever heard her use she said your mother will never meet my child i didn t say anything at the time i wa mostly processing what she said and didn t bring up the subject until my side of the family found out and begun to ask her about the baby she got offended and they had never really spoken to her throughout the year but now she wa pregnant everyone in my family wa fussing over her i agreed with her and told her if she wanted to turn down her advancement it wouldn t be inappropriate when she gave birth a few month ago she told me that she only wanted her mother and i in the birth room i agreed to that and out of excitement i told my brother that she wa currently giving birth i don t know why my brother thought it wa appropriate to post it on facebook but he did and since we hadn t told the nurse that we wanted to close down on visitor my mother showed up with a couple of my family member with balloon in hand to my surprise my mother and wife hadn t spoken a word to each other since the rot bitch event and my wife began to scream bloody murder to get them out of her room and my mother wa refusing to leave saying our daughter wa her family too i tried to coax them out but i couldn t physically push them out of the room until security showed up and escorted them out though my mother wa cry i told my mom that this is not the way to get on my wife s good side and that she pretty much dug a deeper hole when i attempted to enter the hospital room my wife had told the security guard to keep me out i waited outside for a couple of hour until my mother in law talked my wife into letting me back in but she wa extremely angry at me for letting my brother know that she wa giving birth i tried to defend myself by telling her that i couldn t possibly know that he wa going to post on facebook but she shot me down with your family is filled with fucking idiot including me who decides to put up with it that hurt my feeling and i didn t want to cause her anymore anguish during her labor so i left it at that daughter ha been home for two month and i have shut down every attempt of my mother meeting my daughter because i know my wife won t like it out of my immediate family she s the only one who hasn t met my daughter i feel really bad about this situation my mother isn t perfect and neither is my wife but with the holiday season upon u i feel really bad knowing that my daughter will potentially never spend a christmas with cousin from my side i tried to reason with her but every attempt is immediately shut down last time the subject wa brought up she told me that if i attempt to set up a meeting behind her back she d divorce me and not only divorce me she d drown me and i believe her she ha a job that pay 2x of what mine doe and her family is extremely wealthy compared to mine and she s the youngest and the baby of the family and i know her family ha no issue shelling out money when it come to subject like this i know this might paint my wife in a bad light but believe me she s a great person she s open kind and selfless when it come to other subject but this is the only subject where it feel like she s another person she blame my mom for a lot of my issue and i agree with her but i feel like her wrath against her is unjustified and is denying our child of another person who might love them tl dr wife ha turned into a fire breathing dragon over my mom meeting our daughter,0

in law suffocating u when we visit my husband 27m is the youngest of 3 kid 50sf and 32m from his dad 70m and is the only son of his somewhat narc mom 70f a a result he is the golden child of both of his parent while the other two child are ignored this actually doesn t impact u much because the other sibling life in different state a do we they haven t all been together in year and i actually have never met my husband s sister in 5 year of being together anyway we are getting ready to visit his parent for the holiday and i need help setting boundary he is treated like an only child and therefore when we visit their world center around u a the youngest of 5 sibling i m used to having a fair amount of alone and decompression time when i visit my family i need that time to relax stay happy and get my own stuff done however with his family everything revolves around my husband and i we wake up around 8am but his parent wake at 5 they wait for breakfast and a they are disordered eater on very strict schedule who eat minimal food they are starving and antsy by the time we wake up the minute they hear u stirring they start asking through the door if we are ready for breakfast yet and it feel so rushed i don t have time to wake up and i have to be friendly and nice and immediately eat i m not much of a breakfast eater so this drive me a little nut then they try to come with u for every minute of our day and his parent are constantly arguing with each other which get to be so overwhelming they also get wildly stressed out at the tiniest thing e g a missed turn and it just give me so much anxiety for meal we have to plan out exactly where we are going to eat and exactly what time every single day for every single meal sometimes i just want to do thing with my husband and grab a bite if i get hungry without having to focus it around them i hate the expectation that our schedule revolve around each other completely i find it stifling and overwhelming and it make me dread going there i do love them and i think it s important for my husband to maintain a good relationship with his parent even though their behavior towards the rest of the family is very toxic i just don t see how we can ever spend more than 2 3 day with them at once if everything is focused on u being together constantly when we ve tried to talk to them about it it seems like thing go in one ear and out the other for example to stop with the demanding breakfast routine and try to get them to stop waiting 3 hour for u to eat when they re extremely hungry we tried telling them we don t typically eat breakfast so they can go ahead and eat without u they still waited for u and asked for four straight day if we wanted breakfast anyway and kept persisting and kept making comment about u not eating breakfast throughout the day so we begrudging sat down and continued the same routine nothing wa accomplished every time we ve asked for some time to do our own thing or to spend the day running errand together etc it s led to them needing to know exactly when we would be done so that we could immediately go back to being the center of attention after i feel horribly ungrateful saying this because it s obviously better treatment than the sibling who get no love or attention from them but it s just overwhelming and i feel so suffocated so reddit am i being spoiled unreasonable and do i need to just get over it do you have any suggestion for discussing this or setting more firm boundary without offending them tl dr my in law are a bit toxic and they revolve their life around my husband and i when we visit help,0

should i give him a second chance trigger warning his bad past with beastiality nsfw i broke up with my ex 2 week ago we had nearly been together a year it wasnt the most healthy relationship due to him just thinking about himself and his selfishness but i loved him so much none the le and i knew he loved me a well he told me 5 month into our relationship about how he committed beastiality with his dog for 3 year stopped when he fell in love with me he said i opened his mind he told me he absolutely hate himself for how he hurt me and hate what he ha done and he told me in confidence because he loved me and he just wanted my forgiveness we had a talk the other day and we hadn t talked to or seen each other for about 2 week he told me that he didnt realize how much he actually loved me and how much he needed me untill after we broke up he told me he is so sorry for what he ha done to me and the he promise he will do better he asked me for another chance because he just want me back so bad he said he know he probably doesn t deserve it but he said he want a chance to do better and to be better to me and that he know he wa an idiot for not seeing how much he wa hurting me in the first place i have been to therapy for the way this ha affected me but now that he ha apologized so much for what he had done and done to me i just dont know anymore because of course i love him i never stoped loving him that s why this wa so hard for me but i just dont know if i should give him a nother chance i m just confused bc i feel like he deserves love since he regret what he did and he said hed do anything to make it better and to get me back but idk should i give him another chance i m just lost bc of course i want him back but i m just afraid of getting hurt and maybe he just guilt tripping me but i know he really did love me and i know he want me back i just dont know what to do,1

my 30 f boyfriend 34 m of about a year is upset he isn t in my christmas card photo little background my parent and most my grandparent have passed and i am divorced over the year my family photo have increasingly had le people it depressing a hell for me however i treasure photo and it so important to me to have them it s been tough for me to accept that this year there is only me really but christmas card were something my mom always did and i love making custom one on shutterfly and sending them out to what handful of extended family here and friend i have it s something for me not other people so much to keep a part of my mom with me i guess i dunno it sound stupid kind of but it just important to me i have them up from the year in my house and treasure them so i decided this year to do one with just me and my 3 dog instead of just be sad and not have one i also have only been in three adult relationship the main one being my marriage of 8 year and then a short lived couple month thing and then this relationship everything else ha been casual so i don t have much experience dating a an adult so not sure what is correct here anyway my current boyfriend i dated for 10 month and we broke up due to some intimacy issue he ha and something that i did essentially he ha serious intimacy issue and what turn out to be a massive porn addiction after month and month of no sex and absolutely nothing from him he isn t comfortable going down on me or getting me off at all i ended out drunk and slept with someone not defending it i hate people who cheat and never thought i wa capable of it but i guess i learned that in a dead bedroom situation with my guard down it happened we broke up when i told him and when he finally let on he ha a porn addiction basically both have some stuff to work through we kept talking because the rest of the relationship wa amazing and he promised to seek help for his issue and i promised to work through in therapy i ve been in therapy for year anyway how i had let myself being such a lowly cheater and how to work with a high sex drive after a month or so we decided to give it another go i go to my therapy a usual but he hasn t gone to seek professional help and he is struggling to find way to work through thing me cheating made thing much worse for him and i m very remorseful so i m trying to help him through it but i m already super frustrated with no physical contact in two month again well last time he and i did anything wa in august before the split but nothing since we ve been back together for almost 2 month i m trying to be patient because he ha a lot of trauma to work through but he really need a professional and i really am getting beyond frustrated needle to say thing are not going super well and if he doesn t figure out a way to work through thing and at least try and help me with my need in some way we don t have a future it came to a head last night when i wa beyond pent up and frustrated and he wa waiting at my house when i got home i had been expecting my house to be empty and for me to get some me time in since he isn t at a point he can help me with anything i ended up lashing out about my frustration and we got into a fight about how me cheating ha destroyed him and it wa a mess in the end though he ended up cry and being really really upset i haven t asked him to be in the christmas card photo how this became the main point of discussion i don t know but it wa really really clear me not offering that to him while i have been buying matching sweater for the dog the last several month and prepping my mantle for the backdrop this week ha made him feel excluded and closed off and apparently really hurt him and is part of why he is struggling with intimacy right now because he feel left out and inadequate he wa really really upset over this said he would send picture out to his friend and family even if we broke up right after so he doesn t understand why i am unwilling i m not really comfortable sending out picture of u together right now with the state of thing but now i feel really sad about it all and not sure if i am being a jerk or not is this fair for me to do or just rude i don t want to not take the picture and do what i enjoy doing because it s upsetting to him but now i feel unless we break up before christmas it will just be this thing that breed resentment so maybe i should just give up on the idea entirely and let it go i don t know a rocky relationship doesn t seem appropriate to send photo out to people though even if we were happy unless we lived together or were moving in a really serious direction i still would feel this way but maybe i am being a rude bad girlfriend what is normal here should i compromise or give in or just not do any picture tl dr boyfriend and i have rocky relationship after splitting up and then getting back together two month ago thing aren t going well we got into a fight and he is really upset i haven t asked him to be in the christmas photo i plan to send out that will be just me and my dog i don t know what is fair here if i am being a jerk should compromise just not do it or what picture are really important to me and this keep the tradition my mom did going for me since she passed so kind of a big deal for me,0

my 26f bf 31m want to move in together but i am worried about his financial habit cleanliness and communication my bf and i have been dating for 5 year now we met online while i wa living with my controlling abusive parent we lived about 2 hour apart at the time he offered to let me live with him rent free and transfer to a college in his city to get a fresh start after some hesitation i finally gave in and did it when i moved in i had about 21 000 saved up from a previous job it wasn t a high paying job i just never spent any more than the bare minimum on myself i never told him how much i had saved flat out but always helped him when he needed it and paid for my own necessity while he didn t ask for rent he would fall behind on bill and ask to borrow money which i would send him usually about 200 500 or so at a time most of the time it wa never paid back i also paid for grocery brought my car up drove him to and from work anywhere he needed to go and paid for all of our outing and date he had this habit of asking if i wanted to get dinner then saying is it ok if we use your card you get point cash back i also did all of the housework he didn t ask me to but i insisted even though later on it wa a very unfair balance and to this day he doesn t do any housework some month i would pay the rent too i felt indebted to him and to this day have a problem saying no when he asks me for money it became very clear the we had different attitude about money when i took him on a surprise trip overseas i bought our ticket accommodation and paid for the activity thinking it would be a nice surprise but he sort of criticised everything and made me feel cheap for not going with more extravagant option here and there i probably spent about 5 000 on the trip i just remembered this now but one night we were staying in a jungle bungalow and he got upset with me for using his nice toothpaste instead of the one i brought for myself immediately after he asked me to go to an atm to withdraw some more money for a scuba trip he wanted to do up until that point and honestly since then a well he had a what s mine is yours what s yours is mine attitude so it wa weird to see that mask slip off during what wa supposed to be a fun and enjoyable trip over the next 4 year i rotated between job and full time class while transferring him money at least 500 a month his rent wa 600 at the time it s gone up to about 1 000 now buying grocery driving him everywhere and doing all of the housework there wa a period after a very mentally stressful job that made me very anxious and depressed where i wa out of work for nearly a year so i could focus on my mental health starting class again and figuring out what i wanted to do with my life i made to sure to save up 7 month worth of living expense before quitting i always carried my own weight i would often get upset about sending him money because he made no effort to save or prioritize paying off his debt he made the monthly payment but would splurge on expensive impulse buy and treating himself because he didn t feel that we should have to feel poor we qualified for food stamp and i had maybe 10 left in my account i asked him if we could apply for it he refused he got indignant and defensive he said by wanting to go on food stamp you re saying that you don t believe in me you don t understand because you didn t grow up poor so he just kept asking for what little money i wa making from my job at the time instead i want to add here that he s very affectionate loving thoughtful etc i m happy when i with him and really agitated about everything between u when i m not since i moved here he ha sent me surprise gift for my new apartment a tv a mattress topper surprise grocery delivery when i mentioned i wa hungry on the phone i really think that if love language are a thing gift giving is his i m more about quality time and word of affirmation i also stress out when he unnecessarily spends money on me because i know he is drowning in debt but can t protest too much because he say it make him feel bad for doing something nice and then i feel like an ungrateful jerk anyway present day seven month ago i got a job in an entirely new career field that relocated me to the other side of the country it doesn t pay much but i enjoy the job and am able to get by i have a roommate that i like a clean and cute bedroom alone time sometimes i get lonely and only myself and my own budget to worry about i do still send him money when he asks for it because i don t want him to lose his lease but he is better about paying it back the plan wa to do long distance for a while then have him move out here with me he want to move in this spring i told him that i d feel better about it if he worked on paying some of his debt off first so we could both save up to afford a moving truck furniture and a security deposit for a place together we have pet so we can t just sublet a room from someone he said that he feel like he make sacrifice for me all of the time but i d never do the same for him he mentioned me not having a job at time even though i always had money saved to pay for thing give to him and that he didn t want to hold it over my head but it wa true i m living paycheck to paycheck slowly saving it s not much though and he is scrambling for rent every month yes i send him money i would hardly say we re in a situation to do a big move together he said that if i really cared a much and wanted him to move here i would take out a loan i have very good credit and his is abysmal and pay to move him our stuff and the pet here he said that he never got a chance to focus on his own dream because he wa busy supporting mine he would surprise me with gift to encourage my hobby and let me move into his apartment while i went to school he say he wished he could get some time to focus on his dream for once in his life i ended up apologizing during that conversation with his implication i suggested that when the time did come for him to move here maybe i d have enthusiasm saved where he could explore his dream and wouldn t need to worry about looking for a job right away that seemed to be the right answer that s now apparently his plan i visit him about once a month his apartment is disgusting week of dish piled up in the sink gnat in the kitchen dog hair everywhere pile of unfolded laundry on the floor throughout a filthy toilet the bathtub ha a layer of film on it the closet about to burst with an avalanche of stuff he shoved in it on top of it he rarely shower or brush his teeth like week at a time he s always been that way though i have to beg him to maintain his hygiene and even then at most he will only brush his teeth he say he doesn t like getting his hair wet i bought him shower cap he doesn t care it s gotten to the point where i don t enjoy visiting there on my day off i have several panic attack every time i visit because of the mess and filth i can t fall asleep in his bed at night because the dog hair literally get in my nose and mouth from the sheet the only reason i go is to to to clean it up a bit while he s at work i will spend entire day cleaning and it never make a difference it s always the same the next time i return i ve spoken to him about this all at length he say he s overworked from his job and taking care of the dog he said that he might be depressed which i figured but refuse to seek treatment he won t even let me help him find a provider help him with a copay he just refuse to i ve begged him to but he get upset with me and say i don t need grand plan for long term solution i need you to be there for me reassure me and be more positive i ve gotten numerous bacterial and yeast infection from having sex with him we agreed on no present for christmas this year he surprised me with a very expensive computer that he got on a payment plan i ve been trying to find out how much he paid so i can just pay him back for it but he refuse to tell me it s stressing me out i fell really guilty because of this gift it wa so thoughtful sweet and very much needed but i also feel worried that he dropped so much money on it when he should have been paying his own bill and saving up to move if that s what he really wanted and ultimately that make me feel very ungrateful like i said he s loving attentive and caring everyone who meet him for the first time is like wow he s a keeper i love him very much and consider him my best friend in the entire world ha anyone been through this type of situation i can t live with him again if it s going to turn into a debt hole for me endless housework on top of a job and a filthy living environment i ve expressed this to him nicely but he get defensive and i end up cry and apologizing or he refuse to entertain the conversation saying it ll only turn into a fight and hang up on me only to tag me in meme hour later like everything is fine i can deal with depression i have my own mental stuff to deal with but i am happy to support the person i love he s just not willing to make an effort to face his issue or even properly communicate with me without guilt tripping me for prying a close friend of mine think i need to end it with him i almost did but can never bring myself to do it he s texting me right now and i can t even imagine what it will feel like if i broke up with him probably like a death amp x200b amp x200b tl dr boyfriend let me live with him rent free at first so i could focus on school early on in the relationship i paid my own way with money saved from prior job ended up doing all the housework sending him money all the time and depleting my saving we are now long distance and he want to move in with me this spring i want to give him the same opportunity he gave me and prove that i care about him but i have a feeling he will bring our old problem with him for good i have hesitation regarding finance his hygiene and taking on all of the housework again replyforward,0

is my f25 bf m26 a bit of an asshole or is this just how relationship go we ve been together 6 year we live together and i d say 70 of the time i m happy my only major issue is how he speaks to me sometimes for example this morning before i went to work i tidied up the living room and kitchen both our mess then got home from work and made dinner for u we sat and ate it and then he immediately got up without thanking me he never thanks me for dinner walked into the living room and then came back in shouting and swearing at me for leaving my shoe lying in the living room which annoyed me because 1 why doe he notice the tiny thing i do wrong rather than all the thing i am trying to do right and 2 i just don t feel there is a need for a reaction like that i really don t appreciate being sworn at for something so minor i m also annoyed at myself because all i said wa sorry and then went and put away my shoe i never argue back and stand up for myself this might seem like nothing but when it s all the time it start to wear you down i m constantly trying to please him and worrying about what might piss him off next i feel a though i constantly put his need before mine and never get the same in return do i just need to take the bad with the good or is it worth trying to change him tl dr bf shout and swears when i do the simplest of thing wrong should i put up with it fight back or leave him,0
fiancé m30 doesn t post me f26 on his social medium fiance m30 doesn t post me f26 on social medium before i get into it i m just gonna admit that i know this is petty but it s still something that bother me we ve been together 3 year engaged 1 and getting married next year in this whole time we ve been together he ha never posted anything about me on social medium until very recently it wa after i talked to him about it for the second time about how it wa bugging me and i think to make me feel better he posted me on his story after the first time i talked to him about this he stopped posting on instagram at all just on his story and at the time before this he didn t ever really post on his story i didn t even think the two thing were linked and after the second time we talked about it he posted me on his story a few day later and i thought it wa a sweet gesture but honestly now thinking back to it i feel like he could have just blocked certain people from seeing his story he also said he would post me when we had the second conversation but it wa said it out of frustration and it wa definitely if it make you happy but i feel forced to kind of offer i told him not to do anything he doesn t want to do and he didn t post anything in all the time we ve been together i have only met the same group of friend he ha lot of other friend that i haven t met and for the most part they all seem to be woman i haven t really met most of them to be fair he doesn t really see them too often when he doe talk about them he ll tell me that they talked about life and that i even came up in conversation and stuff but i m not sure if he s being honest recently i posted a pick of u and he wouldn t even approve it in his tag even after i mentioned it i don t see any reason for this because my profile is private and only mutual follower would be able to see it i ve posted him before to and he actually removed the tag for one of the picture but not the other i wa just feeling so trusted about being with someone for 3 year and them not posting me even once and then all this weird stuff about the tag that i just got frustrated and deleted all the picture of u together and i decided that i won t be posting him on my story anymore either if he want to act single on social medium then i will too he didn t say anything about me deleting the post and we haven t talked about it since another thing i should mention is that once when we were hanging out with his friend the same group that it always is he wa talking to his friend about a boy trip and how they re gonna take such cool picture and he can t wait to post them i honestly didn t think anything of it because i wa very distracted and enjoying myself but he actually looked over at me and after a few second said to his friend we should make boy squad instagram to post in i don t know what that wa about and i didn t ask him it just weirded me out a lot i just don t know if i m overreacting but 3 year together seems so long for not posting or acknowledging me on social medium except of course the one time i m his story i guess i m just here looking for an outside prospective i m open to any advice please and thank you tl dr been together 3 year getting married soon appears to be single on social medium,0

i m 29f trying to set better boundary with a friend 28f but she s pushing back on them harder than ever i ll try to sum this up a quickly a i can but we ve been friend for 20 year so it might turn into a text wall i d really appreciate any advice but am also just looking to vent so full disclosure on that i have a friend michelle whom i ve known from a young age we grew up together and currently work in the same office my whole life i ve felt that our friendship ha been unbalanced sometimes moreso than others i ve definitely made her more of a priority while i ve felt somewhat sidelined by her at various point in our relationship i m now working on enforcing better boundary so that the friendship is more equitable but she doesn t seem to be accepting that i m no longer a available to her a i used to be michelle got engaged back in the winter and didn t ask me to be in the bridal party which i wa okay with i m not a big wedding person anyway but rather than be upfront with me about it she never said anything one way or the other and then randomly sent me a weird text a few month later apologizing and saying that she didn t ask because she didn t want to pressure me i would ve preferred to make the decision for myself but anyway no big deal she said she wa going to have a cottage weekend for the bridal party and invited me and my partner to it and wa very enthusiastic so i said we d love to come month pas and i don t hear anything else about it at the very end of the summer she sends me another text telling me that my partner and i are essentially uninvited to this event since they ve switched location and there wouldn t be enough space for u to stay overnight at the cottage i would ve been happy to bring my tent this really hurt me i thought it wa awful of her to uninvite u and not even tell me in person a a side note i ll always hear of her having friend up to their cottage for the weekend i ve never once been invited in 20 year no idea why on top of that i ve had so many awkward moment at bridal shower and other event where people have just assumed i m in the wedding party i m embarrassed to admit that i actually came home and cried after attending the bridal shower it felt like i wasn t a part of her life in the way i thought i wa and that led me to the realization that i ve probably been putting too much effort into our relationship the final straw wa a couple week ago when michelle suggested she should stop by my place on saturday to watch a movie i text her on the saturday afternoon to see when she s planning on coming because i wanted to buy some snack she text back a couple hour later telling me that she ended up going to another friend s place instead for no discernible reason it wasn t an emergency or anything i wa furious and didn t respond she literally invited herself over and then still didn t turn up the next day she tried calling me multiple time and then texted saying that her and her husband would be in the area if we wanted to hang out i told her we weren t available and left it at that ever since then i ve been giving myself some space from the friendship and have been prioritizing other friend and le responsive to text not making any plan with her other than lunch or brief chat on work time it s hard to explain but michelle ha this kind of charm to her and i usually find myself losing my resolve and going back to the way thing were but this time i m being really firm in my boundary and acknowledging that that s what s best for the health of the relationship and for both of u long term i m a recovering people pleaser so this ha been a tough thing for me she isn t responding well i think she feel really guilty and is now constantly trying to make plan with me inviting herself to thing i m doing i m finding it overwhelming and it s ironically making me pull away more because i feel like she only want to hang out to assuage her conscience not because she actually enjoys spending time with me i m not sure i feel the same about our relationship anymore and would be happy with it being more casual how should i approach telling her this or is it better to keep enforcing the boundary with the hope that she ll take the hint soon tldr long time friend ha a pattern of treating me a a back up friend and being flakey with plan and i m no longer putting the same effort into our relationship she s picked up on this and is constantly trying to make plan with me which is exhausting how do i deal with this,0

is it normal for my dad to ask me to take nap with him i am a 25 f warning this could be triggering to some in my house it s considered normal to sleep next to eachother not really at night but sometimes for nap during the day because my parent have the biggest and most comfortable bed sometimes i would go into their room and take a nap and when i woke up my dad would be sleeping next to me honestly nothing weird about that by the standard of my family one day when i wa visiting i fell asleep during the day i didn t remember much of the dream i had except that i felt like i started to wake up but wa too groggy had sleep paraylis to wake up fully i barely opened my eye and saw my dad hovering over me then i slipped back into darkness when i woke up i wa having an orgasm i looked beside me and my dad wa resting listening to his radio i wa kind of confused and creeped out but mostly i wa just embarrassed that i had had an orgasm next to my dad i also don t know if waking up and seeing my dad hovering over me actually happened or if i dreamt that and my mind is trying to play trick on me i decided never to sleep in there ever again however it is still common for my dad to ask if i want to take a nap with him my mom never doe this my dad s really isolated he doesn t work and ha no friend really so i assumed he just liked the company ever since the dream though it creeped me out every time he asked then i remembered when i wa 10 i wa wearing a baggy tshirt with underwear and i walked into the tv room i never thought anything of it a i always did this and my mom constantly walked around in her underwear when she wa getting ready in the morning and my sister wa little so obviously she did too but on this day i remember walking out and my dad getting aggrivated and yelling at my mom why isn t she wearing pant i got so incredibly embarrassed that i had done something innapropriate but then i also felt slightly confused because this wa normal for the woman in my house so after that the pant wearing rule became a thing and remained exclusive to me forever looking back i guess this must mean that my body wa desirable to my dad but my mom and sister weren t i don t fucking know finally i disclosed these detail to my sister who is 19 i remember she slept with my dad every night in her bedroom until she wa 7 or 8 but my parent were actually trying to phase her out of this and she would scream cause she wa scared to be alone so again maybe not my dad being creepy when i told my sister she remembered when she used to sleep with my dad in her room she started cry and said one night she wa falling asleep when my dad suddenly asked are you touching yourself she said that she had just been lying perfectly still so there wa no reason for him to think that and that she didn t even really understand what masturbation wa at the time but realized a couple year later what he might have meant we talked all night and i ended up sleeping on her bedroom floor we woke up to my dad opening the door and saying did you guy enjoy sleeping next to eachother it s kind of fun to sleep together isn t it okay my dad is freaking autistic or something and probably didn t realize why this sounded weird but after the conversation me and my sister had just had it wa the worst possible timing he could have said this me and my sister just exchanged look and got pretty freaked out we both think our dad is really weird and ha some issue but at the end of the day we decided we were probably just being paranoid and that we shouldn t worry or give it any extra thought because we don t even have any evidence this morning 3 year after me and my sister talked about it my dad just rekindled my fear i m over visiting we re just having coffee and he just casually brought up how his old friend had sex with her older brother when she wa 12 and he wa 17 and that she said she liked it he went on to say i m not so black and white about everything like you might think i am i think about thing in a pretty nuanced way this is the second time he s mentioned incest this week but before it wa about his exwife s brother wanting to have sex with her i think i m letting paranoia get the better of me and there are some reason he would say this i have been talking a lot about how i want to have a le biased opinion towards thing in general that could be why he said he doesn t always see thing in black and white but using incest to demonstrate his point really freaked me out am i making a mountain out of a molehill here i think maybe i should just see a therapist i have experienced sexual abuse from a boyfriend before before i ever had the dream at my parent house and maybe since then it s just been making me interpret everything in a sexual way after the abuse from my boyfriend i definitely fixate on sexual thing a lot and ob over them so i m totally open to the idea that this might be my problem not anyone el i m getting to the point where thinking about sex make me angry and sad and sometimes i think i just shouldn t attempt to have sex ever again because it make me so upset,1

my brother in law s 40m kid 7f 11m are unvaccinated i 34f don t want my kid 4f and newborn to be around them how do i approach this subject without feeling getting hurt especially with xmas around the corner maybe a bit of background about family dynamic my husband 38m is very close to his family his family is caucasian and from a small town and are quite religious going to church every sunday bible study group etc i 34f on the other hand is of a different ethnicity english is my second language and i grew up with a different religion although they have tried their best to be inclusive of me and to get to know me being a quiet introvert who ha trouble opening up and dislike social and family gathering i have never really felt like part of the family even though it wa never verbalized i know that my shyness is perceived a aloofness and they in general think that i do not like them this is not true i have nothing against them and think that they are nice people i just do not like family gathering and social interaction another source of tension is that my husband ha stopped going to church since moving to my city about two hour away from them and our kid are not baptized his parent have voiced their disappointment on numerous occasion both in regard to u not being a religious a they wish and them not seeing u enough because of distance anyway my brother in law and his wife are anti vaxxers and their two kid are unvaccinated when my daughter wa born 4 year ago i had concern about her being around their kid at the time however i felt pressured to bring her to family gathering since we were just married and i didn t want to cause family conflict when we only saw them a few time per year fortunately she ha not contracted any communicable disease two month ago we had our second child this time i feel that the state of the world is a bit different from 4 year ago measles outbreak is actively happening and there are stronger and much more visible opposition against the anti vaccination movement it is also flu season i absolutely do not want my newborn baby around their kid given the family dynamic and my relationship with my in law i m really not sure how to approach this subject without making everyone hate me especially when christmas is very important to them and it s just around the corner i would love to be able to just say f what they think and just stop going to family gathering entirely but that would be the end of my relationship with them this is not ideal because my husband highly value his family and love his niece and nephew and i don t want him to lose them there just doesn t seem to be a good solution tldr christmas is around the corner how do we tell my husband s anti vax family that i do not want my newborn near their unvaccinated child without causing huge conflict in the family and damaging already delicate relationship,0
i 21m am blind how can i make my new girlfriend 19f feel beautiful i have an genetic eye disease that caused me to start going blind when i wa 16 over the course of the last 5 year my vision ha decreased and at this point i can only see vague color and light darkness i basically have given up on trying to use my vision i walk with a white cane and read braille which i started to learn in my teen once it wa clear that my vision would fully go away i withdrew socially for most of this time because everyone always felt sorry for me and i couldn t stand it i wa very depressed and had a hard time connecting with people a most people my age have never dealt with anything like this and they didn t know what to say i don t blame them this past year i have accepted my reality gotten on med therapy for my depression and tried to reach out more a i am very lonely i met a girl who doesn t feel weird around me and we became very close friend i had a very big crush on her but i assumed a seeing person would not want to date a blind person especially a blind person who is still trying to learn the rope of my disability but she actually asked me out which i wa surprised by she is really really great we re really open about my blindness and she s not afraid to ask question about it even if they re kind of stupid question which i appreciate when we had sex it wa my first time doing it a a blind person and it wa a fucking mess but we laughed our way through it and now it is a lot better it s still early day 2 month but i really like her i can t see her i can tell that she is pale with blond hair but thats about it i have a few seeing friend and they have told me that she is beautiful and i can tell that she is really conventionally attractive because she get a lot of compliment and attention from guy she doesn t show interest in them but it still make me sad i can t compliment her on her makeup or outfit or face because i can t see them i can t tell when she dress up for me or when she s done something new i wa in one relationship in high school when i could see and i really enjoyed complimenting my then girlfriend on thing like that i want to make my new girlfriend feel beautiful but i don t really know how there are lot of thing i find beautiful about her like her laugh the certain tone and cadence she ha in her voice her analytical way of thinking i love how small her hand are and how she caress her finger over mine when we hold hand and she s always swinging her leg or fidgeting in some way which i find really endearing the sound of her breathing is a really nice sound and i ve realized everyone s breathing sound a little different but the sound of hers is my favorite she wear bracelet that jingle when she move and i love the sound of them there are many more thing but all of these seem stupid to say out loud i wish i could compliment her smile or her eye or something like that something that normal guy like maybe it s stupid but i m afraid she will not feel attractive because i find it pointless to call her pretty she know i can t see her i m afraid she will get bored and will want a guy who will compliment her on the way her face and body look a lot of guy already do including my seeing friend who upon meeting her will say to me dude she s really hot pretty attractive how can i find a way to tell her that she really is beautiful to me even though i personally can t see her physical beauty tl dr i am blind and struggling to find way to compliment my gf on her beauty in a way she will appreciate,0

doe it ever get better if you don t leave i have been with my partner for over two year now our relationship ha always been unconventional mainly due to me being all in and him not so much but regardless we havent really left each other s side since the day we met i feel a close connection to him one that i can only describe a a feeling of safety and home even though those are not the word i would have used to describe u i am able to answer my own question in a sense because i know this will never become a relationship in which i am loved cherished or appreciated like i have always dreamt of i feel like i can live with that what i cannot live with anymore is the verbal and physical way in which he release his frustration with his own life on me i can imagine that he will become the man i once knew again once he get himself back together and i am happy to help every step of the way but will i ever be able to get the image out of my head recently i have been trapped replaying the worst moment every second that i don t have something to distract me,1

talking to my narcissist ex again ha helped me in a strange way so i went no contact with my ex for 2 month and he recently started talking to me again i know it wrong to talk to him but i used to be so blinded by my love for him i didnt see his true self i had been feeling like i made a mistake in breaking up with him but then just one conversation i had with him helped me see how right of a choice it wa and it s like all that doubt i had in my head completely went away it s kind of eye opening for me in my situation like i ve realized how better off i am now and it just so clear how much i ve grown since i broke up with him i m just really happy cause like for the first time in 2 month like i feel like my own self like i see how better my life is without him how mentally better it is it s like i can see what i couldn t and that s really good because my mind wa trying to trick me back to him and all i needed to see the truth wa to talk to him to see how better off i actually wa like i didnt fall for any of his trick and it just feel so good,1
is this wrong or am i just stubborn i ve never had a huge sex drive and being in a long distance relationship make it easy to stay away from sex my boyfriend always push me to get him off but i feel so uncomfortable i m not sure where this uncomfortable feeling come from when i talk about sex and it make me feel like a bad girlfriend for not fulfilling that need of his everyday he tell me i m useless because i can t do one thing and it kill me because i know i should be able to but my brain literally cant think of anything when he say to turn him on through the phone this is probably stupid but i need some insight we ve been together for a year and friend for about 3 i dont think i can handle losing him should i just suck it up and send him pic so i dont have to talk or how do i push myself to talk about something that make me uncomfortable,1
i 25f am considering dumping my bf 23m over group sex that i originally agreed to i posted on r aita but they said these kind of post were banned so i m hoping to find out if i m in the wrong for considering breaking up over this i ll write out most of the relevant detail here but ask away if you need to we ve been dating for 2 month and we ve had several conversation over his lack of experience i m his first gf and only 3rd sex partner and what we consider cheating etc i told him in the beginning and all along that i don t stay with cheater and i am monogamous so there s really no way for him to say it is news to him so the main idea though is we got invited to a party that we knew people would be hooking up at and he asked me in the car ride how i felt if other people wanted to have sex with u i told him no he asked if it d be any different if i wa also having sex with a guy and it wa another couple i told him that i really didn t think that it would matter much and i probably still wouldn t be down for it even though my relationship isn t a likely to be threatened by a couple he knew i wasn t into the idea before we got drunk and then once we got super drunk it seemed like he really wanted to and asked me right on the spot while the other people in question were right there i felt pressured by that and also by his little past experience i felt like he should get to experience other people and i wa being selfish for wanting him to be faithful unfortunately my heart and my head are having some problem coming to a conclusion some people seem to think that me breaking up with him over something i agreed to make me an a hole yes i agreed to it technically and i don t agree with any assertion that it wa forced or non consensual i do feel i could have said no and he wouldn t have done anything bad to me but i wa super drunk just one of my reason that i don t get trashed too often i hate the shitty decision people make when drunk and have been feeling insecure for the fact that i wonder if he deep down feel like he hasn t experienced enough woman yet and couldn t settle down long term because of it all of which is obviously made up in my own head but still something that contributed to me agreeing to it i d rather knowingly see my bf with someone than for him to do it behind my back or dump me so he can go screw around unfortunately i just haven t been able to get past it i have felt for a long time that i could never stay with a cheater much le ever marry one and i know it s not technically cheating but it feel like it i ve always been monogamous and this feel wrong all i can think of is if we ever got married any talk of fidelity and true love would feel like a big fat lie because i don t feel like i would ever cheat on someone i truly loved and they wouldn t either i know it probably sound very naive but it is what it is i m not saying being poly or a swinger is wrong but it s not for me and i did have talk with him prior to the incident that i wasn t cool with him or i being with other people i just felt super pressured and i wa trashed again terrible excuse but it is what it is i can t take back what happened am i being unreasonable i feel terrible because i feel like he probably wouldn t have even tried if he thought i d actually dump him over it i do think he like me even though he himself said he s not in love with me i just feel like the damage is done it suck because i really like him and want to get past it maybe but i also feel like the contradiction of my moral code and fear for the future is this the new thing now is he just going to keep asking to sleep with others am i not good enough tldr agreed to group sex to appease boyfriend while i wa super drunk we had talked prior to getting drunk and in the past and he ha known that i m against poly relationship or swinging in my own personal rship i feel like he sorta took advantage of me being so drunk and got caught up thinking with his dick i just can t stop thinking about how we probably have no future now though because i can t imagine ever being able to marry someone where we hadn t been truly faithful and committed please help me get some clarity on whether this is acceptable and if i should consider anything else while i m deciding what to do,0

how can i 32m convince my fiance 34m to wear the gown he s always dreamed of at our wedding my fiance and i are both gay and we are getting married in about 18 month and were just starting to plan thing like how we want the ceremony to go and everything like that ive known my fiance since we were both little kid and i know for an absolute fact that he ha always always always always always dreamed of wearing an enormous ballgown and dancing a waltz at his wedding he not transgender or a crossdresser or anything like that but ever since he wa six or seven at least he ha been obsessed with the romantic fantasy of wearing a sparkling princessy ballgown like cinderella or belle from beauty and the beast we even talked about it back when i first proposed and he liked the idea of wearing a tux for the ceremony but changing into a ballgown for the reception and our first dance i just think it a beautiful idea letting the little boy who wa teased for loving princess story grow up and dance his first dance a a married couple in a sparkling princess gown i even found a dressmaker who could make a replica of the dress cinderella wear in the 2015 movie which i know is one of his favourite film we watch it when he sick and he swears by it power to make him well again the problem is that a soon a we started actuallys eriously planning the event he seemed to get cold foot he liked the idea before we started booking venue and planning menues but a soon a he realised he would have to actually pick out a dress and commit to the plan he decided it wa too much trouble or he didn t want to bother with the expense i know that the expense isn t the problem my parent are paying for the wedding and they have more money than either of u will ever see but it seems like he scared of what his family will say particularly his dad side of the family he grew up in a very hardcore traditional family which really messed him up a a kid he wa one of those quiet sensitive kid who got bullied by his dad and brother and cousin and everyone at school and i think he doesn t want to wear the gown because he doesnt want to give them any ammunition how can i make him feel supported enough to make the decision without thinking of what other people will think he ha a very avoidant personality where he try not to think about to do thing that might be difficult or uncomfrotable and usually i would just let it go and respect his decision but he been dreaming of wearing a fairytale ballgown and dancing with his prince sinc ehe wa a little child and i don t want him sighing sadly in five year wishing hed worn the dress on the day thats supposed to be all about your dream coming true this ha happened before he said no to thing or avoided thing and then later he s kicked himsef for missing out and felt terribly sad because once the actual pressur eof making the decision is gone he can think about it more clearly and see that he would have loved to say yes any tip on helping him see that what his family think shouldnt matter he s the love of my life and i want this day to be everything he ever dreamed tl dr my fiance ha dreamed about wearing a big beautiful princess gown at his wedding ever since he wa a kid but isn t going to because he scared of what his fmaily will say how can i help him feel supported enough to make this decision without thinking about their opinion on our wedding day,0

my 24f boyfriend 24m and i agreed on terminating my pregnancy but i don t know what to do i ve been feeling like garbage lately and upon a doctor visit the other day to see if i have the flu i found out i am pregnant not very far along only about 6 8 week my boyfriend and i have been together for about 9 year but child aren t in our plan for a while we ve always discussed maybe in our 30 s he s still finishing up with his undergrad he ll finish hopefully in the winter of 2020 and currently work a part time gig i finished with my undergrad in 2017 and am working in my chosen career field i only make about 33 000 a year and the field itself isn t very lucrative so i imagine this is the pay bracket i ll stay at for a while and want to see where i can go with it basically when i told him he said don t worry we ll take care of it implying abortion and we both agreed that the timing isn t right to have a child we have the money for the procedure we never discussed the possibility of keeping the baby this is where it get tricky because i feel an unbelievable weight of guilt for whatever choice i could possibly make i ve always been outspoken about being pro choice and about woman s reproductive right i know that timing is everything when it come to having a baby i know that we re not financially killing it and won t be for a while but i can t shake this feeling of guilt like terminating the pregnancy is not the right thing to do like maybe i want to be a mom like it s my responsibility that i m so simply turning my nose up at i also know how completely unfair it would be to keep this child when my boyfriend ha been so vocal about how unready he is to be a dad i don t feel right or that it s fair to take away his future like that and to practically trap him in a life he ha been honest with me about not wanting right now i don t know how to even bring up these feeling i m having with him a they feel so irrational i also don t think he s going to be very receptive to my feeling of potentially not wanting to have an abortion but i can t really blame him his life would be thrown through a loop too it s a time sensitive topic obviously but also because i happen to live in a state where abortion are harder to obtain after 15 week so do i bring it up how should i bring it up i m truly at a loss here and don t really want to talk to anyone in my family about it for obvious reason amp x200b tl dr my boyfriend and i agreed on terminating my pregnancy but i m having second thought and don t know how to bring this up with him since he s been so open about not wanting to have a child right now,0

recovering from abuse and feeling extremely lost in life advice 24 f i got out of an abusive relationship about 6 month ago but i still struggle all the time he wa extremely emotionally abusive and sometimes sexually abusive for over a year i wa very isolated and he wa all i knew for a long time and i m trying really hard to recover i m feeling very lost in life for a number of reason i have ptsd depression and anxiety a lot of this is from the abuse on top of that i have a lot of other stress in my life and lot of negative feeling towards myself i went to school at a nice university for a while for global study i didn t like it so i stopped and got my cosmetology license i did that for a year and then got bored of that now i have been in school for a year again for computer science i am decent at it but i still don t feel it s something i really see myself doing but i feel it s too late for me to try something else and my depression is so crippling i have a very hard time with school at the minute everything compound on each other i feel like a failure because i can t figure out what i want to do with my life i haven t finished a degree and all my peer are in their career job i want to push myself to finish this degree but i m not necessarily happy in it and half the time i m too depressed to go to class or do my work because of feeling like a failure and because of the abuse all my negative feeling are so cyclical and i start to shut down it s hard for me to function a lot of the time i don t eat well anymore and my room is always a mess sometimes i have a hard time even showering my parent know i m depressed because i m in therapy but they don t know the extent of any of it or really any of my feeling they also don t know i wa abused i don t feel like i can tell them about my struggle with school because i feel like a massive disappointment and it just make me want to disappear i wish i could just be a normal person and function fine and know what i wanted to do and do school well i know i m smart enough but i m just a huge fucking failure i spend most of my time playing video game with online friend and it is the only thing that really make me feel okay i know it s mostly a distraction and it probably doesn t help because i am just avoiding real life and not taking care of myself i asked my mom to come see my tomorrow she life a 2 5 hr drive away and she s meeting me for brunch and we re gonna spend the day together i know it would probably help to open up to her but i have no idea what to say and i m petrified to tell her about the abuse every time she asks me how i m feeling i just try to end the conversation i m not a danger to myself but most of the time i do wish i could just not exist i don t know how to cope with any of this everything feel too big to even take baby step how do i begin to put my life back together how do i figure out what i want and how do i find motivation to try i m so tired,1
my f23 boyfriend m24 slept with my housemate how do i handle the aftermath i should start this by saying that from my perspective moving out isn t really an option for me at the moment and also i want to apologise for the essay it s important context to the current situation my ex and i who we ll call dan had been together for three year the first two of which were really happy we had a really healthy dynamic and we had plan for the future i wa dating my best friend but being at uni can be a really unstable time and last year we moved in together not necessarily because we were ready or even really wanted to but his housing agreement fell through at the last minute and what turned into him staying with me for a couple week turned into a joint tenancy agreement moving in together coincided with dan losing his job and the recurrence of his epilepsy this wa a really difficult time and his mental health deteriorated we lost the closeness and he started relying on weed and alcohol really heavily and his attitude towards me changed i wa covering his bill and even clothing him since he had given up looking for another job and stopped attending class and he became distant and cold and rude and made me feel deeply self conscious he also started behaving shady and lied about small thing and big thing and then hugely gaslighted me about it i eventually and shamefully got hold of his phone and found he d been sexting another girl back home i wa furious but still deeply loved him love meaning toxic co dependency and manipulation and stayed saying we would work through it thing began to look more positive he wa going to therapy found a new job and we were talking about moving to a new city together i found a new house and he found a new place a well i wa really excited about moving since the toxicity of the relationship had really taken it toll on my mental health i needed to make something for my own find my own friend and social life since i d relied on him so heavily then dan s letting agent told him they would need to delay the start of the tenancy agreement on his new house so i agreed that he could stay at mine to fill the gap and it didn t seem like a bad idea a i wasn t even going to be at the house for the first month of the tenancy since i would be working for my parent s business in my hometown over the summer break we spoke on the phone everyday and thing seemed to be going well i wa excited about coming back up and my mental health had improved after some time with the family unit and friend back home then the day before i wa supposed to get the train back and a week before the start of my third year a crucial time the housemate i hadn t yet met who we ll call kate messaged me over fb to say that she and dan had slept together several time over the course of a week and she had broken up with her own boyfriend over it who we ll call tom tom also life at the house he and kate had arrived a a couple and i m good friend with tom it wa through him i found the house i broke up with dan on the spot and he ended up dropping out of uni and moving back to his hometown this wa maybe 6 week ago and my third year ha not been off to a good start my mental health is in tatter and looking back i realise how deeply abusive and manipuative the dynamic wa whether dan wa conscious of that or not he lied about all of it until the very end until i showed him the screenshots that kate had sent me i m not coping well and my uni s student support ha a two month waiting list for counselling kate ha communicated with me over messenger and started out very polite and apologetic if defensive and she told me that dan had said to her that we weren t together and i wa doing him a favour letting him stay there because i felt guilty for cheating on him a total bare faced lie i wa so shocked i told her none of it wa true and she responded with an essay saying that she didn t care which version wa true but that she didn t believe me or trust me and that if i wasn t somehow also guilty then i must just be a nut case for allowing dan in my life i told her about the self esteem and dependency issue and she said i wa pathetic and wa trying to use my mental health a a crutch there wa also a bizarre sense of propriety she forbid me from telling our other house mate there are 6 of u altogether about what had happened because she didn t want them knowing her part in it tom is also deeply hurt and shocked but want to pretend like it never happened and will be remaining here at the house so also doesn t want anyone else to know i respect tom s wish so feel inclined not to talk to the others but it also like i ve just been stripped of a key support network it s a very isolating experience i also don t have the financial mean to move again so soon i can t afford a new deposit till at least after christmas i ve asked kate if we can sit down and talk about it but she doesn t want to since like tom she want to act like nothing happened but everytime i enter a room she leaf it and it make hanging out with the house a a group really difficult especially because i can t say why thing are so strained short of moving out how do i recuperate and heal from the trauma of the relationship and how can i make thing bearable with kate tl dr my boyfriend slept with my housemate how do i go about recovering from an emotionally abusive relationship whilst living with the girl he cheated with especially a her behaviour ha become progressively unpleasant moving out is not a reasonable option at the moment,0

i 26f am ready to separate from my husband 31m and it s going to be pretty ugly in need of some hard truth i feel like i m just going to vomit everything out and hopefully it ll make sense i 26f and my husband 31m got married 4 year ago we are a total cliche and got married just before his first duty station assignment after dating for about a year acquaintance for a year prior to it he wasn t a stranger but not really a friend either he wa nice had some anger issue a i wa told by many people including his mother and there wa so very obvious communication issue that i wa too embarrassed to address a very clear sign to not be married the initial plan wa to get engaged and i wa going to stay in my hometown to finish school and i just got a new job that i wanted to stick with for at least a year this wa the plan up until about a month before he wa due to move to his first station i remember that he suddenly called me and told me he thought it would be easier if i just moved with him and that i should put in my two week honestly i just panicked and said yes i should have stuck up for myself but for whatever reason i didn t but the decision came from a place of panic and guilt looking in hindsight i had a lot of people questioning me when i said i wa getting engaged most people thought my husband wa a great guy and we had a bunch of mutual friend i had one friend who took me aside when he heard and wa very blatant on why it wa a bad idea and everything he said turned out to be 100 correct in hindsight i moved with him and everything wa a complete 180 he wa angry at me for not having a job in the first three month when he told me to take my time which i should have just found something at target to get me by def on me i did find a job and the background took nearly two month i didn t drive for that first year because he didn t want to add me to his insurance his friend s wife were extremely unpleasant to me and he didn t believe me it wa overall a very bad first year i m tall and already pretty slim 6 and about 160 when i moved there i lost 40 pound in about six month which he say he didn t notice i wa getting to the point where i didn t have any clothes that fit me anymore and my jean would literally fall off of me i bought a pair of jean from marshall once and he tore me one for buying 70 jean after he dug through the trash for the tag they were actually 20 the original tag wa 70 the second and last article of clothes i bought wa a pair of short that were like 10 and he wa so angry that i just started hiding thing i bought after that for the next few year ever since that first year i grew more of a backbone where i crammed down my own feeling before i tried to confront our problem and bring them up i wa the only that did this in the four year for most thing he put only the amount of effort he want to he doesn t start conversation he won t do thing until i ask yada yada sex is terrible and one sided we ve had this discussion several time and thing change for maybe the first week and then go back to how they ve been it s been so terrible like cry in the middle of sex terrible he wa overseas for a few month and that wa the only time i really felt relaxed i didn t have to worry about him getting mad at people thing i used to enjoy i felt like i could enjoy them again it wasn t until he wa back until i realized how stark the contrast is between him being there and not and it s a lot le stressful when he s not there i ve been mostly keeping my friend and family out of my problem but when i tell them something he say or doe they all seem taken back watching my friend who are in healthy marriage doesn t remind me of my own i ve been told i avoid talking about him at all if possible this spring he wa suppose to get out of the military but decided to extend i always hated the city we were in and decided to move home after getting accepted into a program that i had been in i ll graduate even earlier in fact we had a talk a month before i left about how thing hadn t been good and it didn t really have a resolution we tend to pretend thing will go back to how they were without putting any real effort into making them better i don t think we know how to either i moved back home a few month ago and although he wa freaking out about it we decided it wa something i needed to do he and i barely talk but it s mostly on my end sometimes it s not something i m consciously doing but my instinct reaction is to put off his message we don t really have anything to talk about besides hello how wa work goodnight my friend and family had refused to talk to me about him until recently i just found out there are a ton of rumor circulating but i did move back without the full intention of divorce it s always lingered there but when thing are okay i talk myself out of it when i moved i realized i wa happier but i felt like i didn t have any reason to ask for a divorce i have had a few conversation where people just ask me and it must just be obvious on my face that thing are not okay i ll start out with a lie but it always come out since people have heard i ve come back without him i ve had an outpour of people asking if i m okay or they can see me the thing is i feel like i ve been upfront with my husband about how thing haven t been working out we ve had talk we ve had talk about therapy i went to one we talked about going together but it didn t happen and i m exhausted from it thing aren t going to work out it s very obvious that they aren t but to him thing are great we have no problem and we never have i feel like he s satisfied to drift though this like we re floating down the lagoon but i m white water rafting through it instead i m going to talk to him on saturday about it and going to tell him that we need to separate he s going to cry and ask where this is coming from he s a pretty lonely person and always lure me back into you re all that i have sometimes i feel like i m blindsiding him with my problem but i have talked to him about them we ve talked about them many many time he just forgets that we ve had those conversation and maybe that s why thing never change either so i guess i m here for a preptalk maybe i am just giving up on this marriage and need to be told i just need someone to very clearly say i m doing the right or wrong thing if there is even such thing tldr rushed into marriage wa incredibly awful moved back home and want to separate how do i maneuver this mess,0

i 25f asked my so 25m what i thought wa a reasonable question he think it wa loaded and unfair so i ve been with my boyfriend for about a year and a half he s quite stoic not very emotional he ha a tendency of just saying or doing anything to keep the peace and hate conflict we ve sort of fallen into a pattern of me wanting thing to talk more to do more thing etc and him doing them to make me happy nearly every time he doe these thing or i bring up that they re important to me he say that those specific thing are not important to him here is a list of thing he s stated are not that important to him physically being in the same place we ve recently gone long distance not far though about two hour away from each other and when i mention i would like to see him more or be together more he say that being physically together isn t a big deal for him or not a important a it is to me he say that he doesn t mind going to see me a long a it s not inconvenient sex our life ha dropped off since we first started dating not significantly about twice a week now instead of five or six not a big deal he s mentioned before that sex just isn t that important to him it s fine and he like it but not a priority he rarely initiate anymore physical affection of any kind he s not a cuddler at all he doesn t care much for kissing he ll mostly do it because i want it i feel though he hasn t stated this expressly communication since we ve been together he s stated that he doesn t feel the need for any type of meaningful communication or to talk much he will do it to please me doing activity together he doesn t feel the need to do anything specific together doesn t see the point of dinner out doesn t see the point of social event holiday together he hate holiday doesn t see the point in them this list go on but these are the main one also these thing came out slowly during the course of the relationship he would do the above activity and only later tell me he did them for me the only activity he s ever said he enjoys doing with me is watching a movie together at home he also enjoys buying little gift for people in general and will buy me little thoughtful gift last night he told me that he can t afford to come visit me it is about a 50 flight because he s decided to go to a wedding his friend s ex girlfriend s sister s whom he ha never met don t ask where he will spend way more than that i ve come to visit him twice in a row and can t travel during the period we re both free because my own sister is visiting during that time from europe he s close with my sister btw and him not visiting will mean he won t see her a well i said that two month of not seeing each other is long for me and that it sucked i wasn t angry but definitely upset and i said i didn t want him to not go to the wedding i actively encouraged him to go but that i feel he doesn t ever put anything in our relationship on priority he then told me again how the same thing that are important to me in the relationship aren t important to him so i said okay you ve told me many time about the thing that aren t a big deal for you aren t a priority and that s valid so what is important to you within the relationship i said it doesn t have to be the same thing a mine but surely there is something within the relationship that is sacred or a priority for you he said that wa a loaded and unfair question and refused to say anything he then said that some of the thing i stated were important to him just not a important a they are to me and not something he would necessarily sacrifice other thing to do i just said goodnight and hung up after that and now don t know what to say he is a kind person and i appreciate that he doe thing to make me happy but i wish there wa anything he did just because he wanted it must be tiring for him to constantly be doing thing he doesn t want to do and it s tiring for me to know it s always always a chore for him i don t know if it wa bitchy of me to put him on the spot or if it s something valid that should be addressed we are so different but i enjoy being around him and i really do care for him i m just starting to feel that we are too different and want very different thing tl dr my boyfriend ha a list of thing he doesn t consider super important in a relationship i asked him during a semi argument what he doe consider important he thought i wa being unfair and ha still not answered,0
all my love just went away like a light switch after leaving my nex for good 12 day ago my love for him is completely gone for a while about a year i wa convinced that man wa the love of my life and everything i could have dreamed of and i made sure to always tell him that at 1 5 year in his mask began to slip hard he yelled at me twice with such rage i knew deep down it wa over at that point but i held on half heartedly for another 6 month of him breadcrumbing me for a total of 2 year with that demon after i finally left him 12 day ago my love or should i say the spell just wore off very quickly im talking about just 5 week ago i sent that man a message telling him i loved him with all of my heart after i left him i swear every bad thing that he did to me that i pushed down or ignored while we were together came up i don t love him i don t even like him i don t care about him at all,1
sanity check my 29 partner 28 of three month is considering marrying his ex so she could become a citizen btw they still live together i m 1 000 not okay with this but my partner think it s okay because it s a matter of principle he got extremely upset when i brought it up the issue is far more convoluted and nuanced but for surface level context they were together for over 5 year and he met me a week after they broke up and they still live together am i crazy or is this incredibly messed up and what do i do i love him and don t want to break up but i also can t accept this tl dr my parter would marry his ex so she can become a citizen and i don t know what to do,0
my 24f boyfriend 26m and my bf s ex have same suspicion about his girl best friend i know the title is a bit confusing but i can go more into detail down here so my boyfriend ha had this longtime friend whom he is very close to i have been suspicious that there may have been something there between them in the past my boyfriend claim to have had a crush on her at some point but that he moved on in order to keep their friendship his girl best friend ha always seemed to have dated everyone but him and i think he got the memo anyway we have had argument about this mostly because at first he claimed that there wa no emotion between them and then changing the story to he once had a crush on her but that s it the girl best friend seemed to have enjoyed his attention and the fact that he wa always there for her when she needed him tonight i thought he almost called me by her name and stopped mid sentence i confronted him and asked if he wa accidentally going to state the wrong name and he denied he then proceeded to tell me how his ex had the same issue with his girl best friend and he didn t understand why we both felt so threatened i sarcastically laughed at the situation since i wa like great his ex girlfriend noticed their dynamic and came to the same conclusion so should i be worried i m a bit hurt that he s comparing me to his ex in this regard and wa wondering if she and i both have low self esteem to feel threatened by this girl on the other hand i find it interesting that me and his ex came to the same conclusion not sure if this is a red flag that is going to bite me in the as in the future tl dr me and my boyfriend s ex have had the same suspicion about the girl best friend,0
my 28m girlfriend 27f wa absolutely convinced i cheated on her and broke up with me and said some nasty thing she only just found out that i didn t how do we heal from this major rift in our relationship i m not even entirely going to go into the detail here it wa a distant blurry video from a nightclub that my girlfriend friend sent to her of a guy who looked very similar to me making out with another girl it looked exactly like me from that view even if it wa maybe 4 5 second of footage i would think that wa me too if i didn t know better and when my girlfriend confronted me all of the i swear thats not me just looked like a bad trope of a guy denying something obvious anyways the way i ended up proving it to her wa that i had to ask my girlfriend friend where she found the video instagram which resulted in her also being mad at me too for even asking but she told me regardless the day it wa posted wa october 19th when me and my girlfriend were together the whole night i also pointed out that the guy shoe were not mine and that she know i only wear 2 pair of shoe and the most damning evidence wa that the club it wa at all the way in westchester we live in south jersey here the thing it took her more than a whole day to respond to that i know she saw it i provided all the evidence possible that the guy wasn t me and it still took about a day and a half for her to even respond amp x200b but that isn t even the worst part the night she confronted me wa horrible we ve been dating for nearly 4 year and she s never said this stuff to me she said i wa a weak person who wa insecure about his life so i secretly go out to find other girl she said that i wa always going to be jealous of my brother who is more successful than me and get girl and all that and that me going out to that club wa just me trying to imitate him she said i never cared about her and that i clearly dont love her at all and that i will always put myself above her she accused me of lying about being depressed just so that she never suspect anything when clearly i ve been having a blast going to club and sleeping with girl she wa absolutely furious and the entire time i kept thinking just turtle up and try not to respond emotionally wait until you can prove her that the cheating isnt real but the accusation just kept coming i ended up cry and leaving amp x200b when she finally responded to my evidence about the cheating she sent this entire paragraph to me saying she had spent the last few day thinking about how her life wa going to be without me and that she ha been trying to erase all love of me from her brain by thinking about every little way i have ever hurt her even a tiny bit to try to make it easier to leave me she said she felt horrible about what she said and that she want to make up for it and she is sorry about everything and so we got back together that day except it wa incredibly awkward and tense and it ha sort of remained tense i mean in our 4 year relationship we don t typically fight it been an amazing relationship overall and so for this to feel so uncomfortable it just feel wrong i feel like when she found out i wa cheating she just unleashed everything onto me that she didn t really want me to know beforehand i don t think either of u fully know what to do i keep thinking of how she just looked at me with absolute disgust like real hatred in her eye and it just hurt me so bad to think she felt that hatred for so many day amp x200b how do we recover obviously couple therapy is gonna be recommended but besides that i am not even sure if she would agree to couple therapy honestly we cant really afford therapy like that amp x200b tl dr girlfriend thought i wa cheating broke up with me said a lot of nasty thing about me i showed her that i wasn t cheating and our relationship been very weird and uncomfortable ever since,0

is yelling normal my 25 f husband 25 m yell at me pretty regularly over our two year marriage he ha done it maybe 20 time with very loud continuous screaming and insult over very trivial issue he ha a lot of abusive tendency which are causing me to end the marriage however he ha consistently expressed that yelling and putting down swearing happens in every marriage during fight he even say it fine to do it with our baby around so she will learn that conflict is normal i don t believe this is true and want to feel like there is hope i will be in a healthy marriage with someone someday and will absolutely be getting the heck out of this one with my baby my parent also had an unhealthy marriage full of yelling and swearing so my question is ha anyone been in a relationship of significant length and depth that had very little or no yelling and swearing or is it normal tldr husband yell at me all the time and say it s normal is it,0

i f23 think i need to break up with boyfriend m26 because of his hygiene and appearance we ve been dating since september of last year this is my first post here hopefully i follow the rule correctly so i have been trying to make our relationship work despite hygiene and appearance issue but i don t think it is working his living situation is not ideal it is a small place shared by a dirty roommate there are some thing he can t change about the place unless he move but he basically let the place get filthy until i say something pile of clothes everywhere dead and live roach live come out at night very dirty floor caused by the dirt outside but must be maintained that he doesn t clean with enough frequency trash can always overflowing unless i say something when we began dating he would let his large dog he did not bathe which wa covered in flea sleep in the bed with u i got him to stop that a while ago but the fact that it only stopped after i complained of getting bit several time still bother me he gotten better about cleaning but still let thing get disgusting before he clean so it s better than when we started but my biggest thing right now is his appearance and hygiene his dental hygiene is very bad and he desperately need to go to the dentist but hasn t he ha visible plague and i ve noticed and commented several time on the fact that he will leave the house kiss me after not brushing or only using mouthwash he doe shower everyday so that s not a problem but his house clothes he will put on after a shower are usually being worn for week and will smell like fart majority of his clothes are old stained have hole and he wear old ratty flip flop whenever possible i will dress nice or even just casually and he will look close to homelessness when we are going out i have to remind him all the time when he need a haircut which make me feel controlling and abusive his hair is very curly and fluffy so if it is not maintained he look homeless other people including at work will comment on it for a week and he then he finally doe it he used to do it himself and would cut it in such a way to where it would age him not exaggerating 15 20 year in a bad way whether he would go and get it cut or do it himself he would still wait until it wa a mess to do anything about it there is a lot more but i feel i ve gone on and on i ve tried many different way to try to combat the issue i ve asked if it wa mental health which he s said contributes but this is all the time i ve tried buying him new clothes and gently pointing out why the others were not acceptable i ve tried explaining that i wish he wanted to put in effort for me the way i do for him and that it make me upset that he doesn t i ve tried cleaning with him and without him but he won t do it if i don t say anything i love him and he wonderful otherwise but this is a deal breaker i ve seen advise say that this is an attempt to change someone that doesn t want to be changed and i m wondering if that is what this is this situation make me feel controlling and i don t want to be like that so do y all think this is incompatibility and that i have tried what i can do y all think there is something else i can do etc tldr boyfriend neglect appearance and hygiene of living space and self i ve tried different way to work with him but nothing seems to stick should i chalk it up to incompatibility and move on,0
i m not sure if this is abusive i didn t see anything in the rule about this sort of thing so i hope this thing is alright on mobile formatting yadda yadda i kinda feel like my relationship is a bit mentally abusive but then again it s not that bad so surely it s me overreacting but then again that s what victim in abusive relationship feel like i feel confused so i figured some outside input would be helpful i have been in a relationship with my bf for over 4 year red flag imo popped up early on but i felt that i could deal with them he didn t want me to talk to any men especially not my male best friend since we were 10 and he didn t want me associating with them at school i thought he wa the one so i figured this wasn t an unreasonable request he criticized the way i wanted to dress but would do it in a nice way if that make sense i figured if he thought i looked beautiful a i wa just plain jane that i could live with dressing how he liked the only friend i were allowed to have were one he approved of and he didn t like one that slept around had colored hair or a funky hairstyle when i befriended one of my closest friend to this day she wa in a controlling relationship and he didnt allow her to talk to other men my bf hated this i wasn t allowed to hang out with her without him giving me the silent treatment his reasoning for not wanting me to be with her wa because it would take up all our time to talk on facebook ironic and he said he had to interview her to see if she wa good friend material for me her boyfriend didnt like the idea and frankly neither did she bc she shouldn t have to be questioned just to be my friend he responded that she wa being a bitch when i got the side of my head shaved he acted like it wa the worst betrayal throughout our relationship he s been addicted to a substance called phenibut and whenever something didnt go his way or i did something he didnt like he would take a bunch of phenibut to where he d pas out and i d freak out thinking he d killed himself when i got my head shaved he said that he wa thinking about going to his doctor for help with the phenibut but that i might a well forget it now speaking of he s battled addiction to different thing our whole relationship mostly to alcohol and phenibut but also kratom and kava when he would use these he would stay up all night blasting music and being loud a shit while i cried in the bedroom because i felt lonely and i knew i wasn t going to get any sleep before work the next day i would have to stay up all night with him making sure he didn t die and he didn t seem to care it took me bawling and begging him to get rid of kava but then he went right back to phenibut it got to the same point again and he s quit phenibut but now he s saying he never feel happy and keep asking me to buy him more kava i reminded him how much that hurt me and he say that at least i wasn t with him when he wa an alcoholic he quit soon after we got together and that that wa way worse than anything he wa putting me through for my birthday this past year he didn t get me anything boo hoo so sad but he decided to use the last of his money to buy whip it and kava that really stung i cried and told him how much this hurt my feeling and said you always say you ll do anything for me so why can t you do this meaning give up the substance and he got mad and asked why i wa making it all about me in some way he s gotten better but in other way he s gotten worse whenever i bring up wanting tattoo or piercings or even shaving the other side of my head he asks me why in an angry tone and go on a tangent about how unattractive they are over time i ve learned that he s somewhat racist and he say the n word just to get a reaction out of me and whenever he see a couple of mixed race he talk about how disgusting he think it is he sexualizes little kid he s not attracted to them but he call prepubescent girl who wear legging or short short little slut or teen mom in the making he want child and i used to think i wanted child with him but i don t want that anymore i don t want a kid to grow up with that sort of influence i recently adopted a dog and a cat from the animal shelter because i felt lonely the cat is a baby and us her claw to play the dog is also a baby and doe not know basic manner working on it when he get mad at the animal doing the thing they do he threatens to wring their neck or kick them this is only a few thing and the thing that have bothered me the most even if it s not abusive i am unhappy and want to leave but i feel like i can t he say he would start using heroin or just straight up kill himself if i left him he always paranoid that i am going to leave or that i m going to cheat or someone is going to convince me to leave cheat on him i pay for everything since i m the only one working he disabled so if i left he would lose the car most of his food the ability to have fun thing even though i am unhappy with him i dont want him to be unhappy or sad or have anything bad happen to him i want the best for him i still feel like this post is stupid it s not that bad a bad a it could be a bad a other actual abusive relationship i read other post in here and i feel like i m just sensitive and emotional and that i overreact at least he doesnt hit me though he punch and throw thing when he get mad but that s not a bad a hitting me or my pet there are time where he will lay with me and cuddle and he ll tell me how much he love me and how special i am to him there are time when he is really trying to better himself and i m so proud of him he talk about how he love the dog and the cat and say that he d be sad if anything happened to them i m confused some outside opinion would be helpful like i said i hope this kinda thing is allowed,1

the fear to fall in love again i don t really need reassurance or anything i want to vent the fear of falling in love again the fear of the possibility that someone could be manipulating you the fear of someone creating hope and dream with you but end up burning them all one by one right in front of you the fear of giving my all and getting absolutely nothing in return the fear of watching them change daily but you re forced to keep your mouth shut to avoid any lash the fear of being lied to the fear of being left alone the fear of feeling like you re not their priority the fear of speaking up about how you feel the fear of being neglected the fear of silence the fear of seeing those cold angry eye the fear of leading your loved one to a suicide attempt and to be blamed for it the fear of being the bad guy the fear of new beginning the fear of losing myself all over again my heart ache each day that it get to the point i feel so numb and weak i feel so uncomfortable when men flirt with me i get so sick to my stomach when i think about dating and marriage the idea of having a family is all too foggy for me i miss him but i m thankful he s no longer torturing me,1

wa she manipulative and emotionally abusing to me idk how to feel about what happened hey i m a guy and i recently blocked and ended a relationship with a girl it s sort of weird and i ve been reflecting on if she wa abusive and manipulative or not i used to love her so many incident slipped away and i let them pas but then i realized she wa guilt tripping me whenever i had a concern about our relationship she would always tell me how i wanted so much attention and she wa tired and never had time for that note i only went out le than 10 time with her through around 1 year and 7 month cause she wa always busy whenever i confronted her on how i felt she didn t care she would victimized herself by saying sorry i m not enough for you you never look at the good and are extremely negative and i believed her cause i thought may be i wa overreacting but then i figured she wa always going out with her friend friend because well idk she always talked trash about them saying she didn t like them at all and were terrible and abusive to her so it didn t add up to me she even mentioned her ex every now and then and would rant on how he hurt her even a friend and i always told her and confronted her about how i found it uncomfortable of her to keep someone like him in her life and bringing him to our relationship to what her answer wa always you can t let go of the past what would you do if i brought your ex up which tbh wa kinda messed up she blew up when i told her i had moved on from my past relationship and never ever once i brought it up to her she knew i wa right present she is talking to her supposed abusive ex again a if it wa all normal which i already knew she wa behind my back when together even if i told her it wa uncomfortable and not worth it since well this guy even told everyone he wanted to get intimate with her and had tried to get her into doing stuff and said many thing on how he abused her and how he wa proud i honestly don t get what s up with her she did know he had said the terrible thing that he did so i am confused af she would never make time for me and said she d be busy it went to the extent that i visited her at work to surprise her and by the end of the day she wa like when are you leaving is your uber here yet she never ever seemed to want to see me and then she d complain that i didn t value her or her time nor understood how tired and busy she always wa like idk we all have stuff to do but i could notice she did have time she even once went out with someone 2 hour away when she told me she would try to see me that same day i remember i gave her a ring a well once and it wasn t high end expensive but it had a meaning for u and it wa nice and then she d say like a guy gave me a diamond ring once when i wa 15 omg that is true love and that made me feel my effort with her were just unvalued she didn t value me or what i gave her and that just made me feel so wrong and like trash to the point i would question if i wa doing anything wrong or if i wa the one who wa wrong and not being enough another weird note is she always brought up having a sugar daddy but it being a joke present she did make account on dating apps and jokingly received money from a guy for him jokingly being her sugar daddy so it make me think if she wa ever loyal to me and it doesn t feel alright she usually called me only when she needed something from me or to rant about work or her friend but when i needed help or to talk she even said i could be doing something better instead of helping you she just didn t seem to care about my feeling or our relationship and wa so damn toxic and it s a if she loved toxicity cause she wa with the people she so much complained about and if you ask me seemed to entirely despise them idk what wa going on or if she s okay but the more i think about it the le sense thing make with her and i just feel relieved i am not with her anymore she put me so much emotional and mental distress i still feel terrible when i get the memory and idk sometimes my anxiety still make me think i wa the one who wa wrong and i wa stupid and insensitive and that i never put effort to understand her but my life suddenly is a million time better after i blocked her out of my life i don t feel a depressed and anxious and i feel i have a big weight of my shoulder i just feel sad cause i did have feeling for her you know but idk i feel so numb it s like waking up from a strange sort of nightmare idk how to feel or what to believe or think,1

for her she wa great with him most of the time but if i said i wanted some me and him time i d get either anger and resentment and a blow out or be questioned on why i didn t want to spend time with her i guess a pattern wa a emerging i became a lacky if i wasn t answering her call and doing whatever she desired she d get in a mood or angry at me i ended up running around for everything i ve ended up in debt trying to keep her happy she doesn t drive so i became her taxi i guess if i said i wa struggling to pick her up she would tell me she can get attention elsewhere so i caved i m not

wasn t used to violence well she lost it you re a ducking joke screamed at me in front of the kid and it went on from there i said she wa being abusive and it got worse screaming at me texting a guy and doing so so i could see her making arrangement to meet him that night i dropped her and her daughter at home you think i d leave it there no i m dim i started chasing her she said she want me to fight for her and i did i did everything she told me i needed to do to win her back i watched figuratively a she played me off against other people she said she needed them to make her feel desired and to get better i gave her the space and we eventually got back together she told me all about how the guy she d texted wa better than me in pretty much the every way it killed me she kept wearing the dress i d bought her and she d worn for him it destroyed me i asked her not to but she said she wasn t going to change what she decides to wear because it would undermine her i went along with it so she wouldn t get mad at me again everything went back to how it d been before the cycle began again now she s pregnant and we had another row today we went to book in at the hospital i wa shattered the last few day i ve been running around to make sure she s comfortable and had between 3and4 hour sleep she got angry at me for not being responsive enough in the hospital when she wa talking about

wa i in an abusive relationship i think i wa in an abusive relationship but sometimes i don t know if i m just being dramatic or if this actually all happened i think i need some confirmation in order for me to make closure with it he would constant gaslight me lie or mess up then cover it up by convincing me i remembered wrong or that i wa making a big deal out of nothing at some point i wasn t confortable bringing up my feeling or confronting him with thing i knew he wa doing wrong when i confronted him about lying about his identity and his education and family he attacked me over text saying i wa toxic and ruining the good thing in his life he cheated the entire time the first time i found out he of course gaslighted me and convinced me it didn t count and that i wa being dramatic and petty and demanded an apology from me if i ever brought up any suspicion he would threaten to end the relationship with me i have a sexual dysfunction and he would make me feel like it wa my fault that he had to find other way to get off when hello he wa cheating anyways i found out he wa cheating after the relationship had ended another woman contracted an sti because he ha unprotected sex with all the woman he see he would ignore me for day on end if i said something he didn t like and i had no idea when i would see him again at time then he d act completely normal when he wa ready he called all the shot he never explicitly called me name but would make snide remark he would make comment about my weight or my look and say i looked better year ago and i should go for that look again at the time i thought he didn t mean to hurt me but now i m sure he knew the effect his word had i think i m having a hard time accepting i wa abused because while i cried and felt anxious a lot i never felt threatened or physically afraid at the very least he wa very manipulative he never had a scary tone but sweet talked his way into many of these thing i think because he wa so successful in getting what he wanted at time i can t even admit to myself what actually happened i still feel like although i wa deeply hurt that it s just me being sensitive and not something he intended to do what do you think wa i in an abusive relationship,1

i nearly ended myself last night after she publicly humiliated me i m not sure how much longer i can take this yesterday wa even more painful than the day an immediate relative passed away i wa sat up at 4am desperately trying to suppress the urge to overdose on the antidepressant i had on the desk next to me some detail are changed because she track my online profile we ve been together for nearly two year i m 22m she s 21f we met on tinder and honestly even from the second date between the romance and adoration there were red flag she burst into tear when i asked what we were and she confessed she had only come out of a sexually abusive relationship three week ago a opposed to the two year gap between relationship i had but being ignorant naive and swept up in actually being in a relationship i ignored it and i ll admit for the first month i wasn t in the best place i wa suffering antidepressant withdrawal i wa approaching my final exam and a whole host of family issue arose but we worked through it all and for the most part we were good she said we were a power couple working through our issue and i felt adored and wanted slowly the dynamic began to shift though she said that she loved me five month in and say it constantly along with constantly telling me that she miss me i found it a little overwhelming but didn t think it wa controlling or oppressive she got a job whilst i pursued a master and she hated her work her mood spiralled completely she gave up hobby social circle and instead just played video game all day and messaged me unless she wa at work i became the sole person she spoke to regularly and she began telling me i wa the only person who made her happy i remember one of the first time she got angry is because i wasn t introducing her to my friend she said she felt hidden away so i said i would get it sorted but when she did meet them she barely spoke to them physically clinging to me the entire time afterwards she wa insistent that they hated her this happened on three separate occasion i put it down to anxiety and tried to comfort her a concert came up that we both wanted to go to when the ticket came on sale i suddenly found out i wa too broke to pick one up because of a surprise bill she said she wa too depressed to buy one and went to sleep we agreed that we would try and buy one each second hand and i managed to she said she wa very excited for me and hoped i had a wonderful time with or without her then when the day came she got angry said we should have got a pair of ticket and that i had been ignorant and ruined the day i offered to sell mine to try and get two seated one but she refused and when i left to go to the concert she refused to talk to me until the next evening she still brings it up today slowly thing began to get more and more tricky for me she would constantly change goalpost subject and topic we had once talked about openly now triggered her certain word couldn t be used in her presence despite me having used them before certain friend i had she said were unhealthy for me and she would get angry when i told her i wouldn t get rid of them during a depressive episode she told me to cheer the fuck up because happiness isn t served on a plate whenever she got annoyed she would withdraw all affection and start alluding to killing herself nothing direct just insidious comment such a i hope i don t wake up tomorrow or i m going to do something stupid but i can t find the blade or i m scared to take painkiller in case i take too many lol i told her my plan to do a phd and she told me not to be stupid when i ran for president at my student union she spent the whole week moody refused to help me in any way and when i lost she said at least we don t have to break up now she doesn t want me to get a full time job because it ll mean i have to spend le time with her one time she told me we should go on a break and when i agreed she got angry and said i failed the test whenever i go to concert by myself she always end up in a bad mood or sick or in hospital with something that clear up the very next day on a day i wa at a conference i wa excited for she told me that she had lost her job only for the story to change the next week that it had not been the case at all she insists on telling me bad news real or not every time i go out by myself if i ever meet up with friend she refuse to message because she doesn t want to spoil my evening i feel awful because i ve started not telling her when i am going out because of how moody and passive aggressive she get and yet she still somehow know all the detail it s like she s been snooping on my phone or tapping it she posted on her twitter that she had been out for a drink with pretty boy after cancelling a date with me early to meet up with friend who had been away she ha video of her heavy kissing other girl on her phone she s bi she once got angry and shouted at me in public because i calmly told her to stop playfighting with me because it wa getting a bit rough and i had just eaten she said she just wanted a normal relationship and that i wa too sensitive she told me if i ever turned vegetarian she d dump me so i have to eat meat whenever i go out with her which make me incredibly uncomfortable she broke down because i asked her where wanted to eat saying that i should have organised it because she can t make decision despite me spending 60 for the two of u to do an escape room more than my weekly wage she get angry at me if i don t like all of her selfies immediately on every social medium platform she got angry with me on her birthday because i didn t say happy birthday immediately after midnight she started cry when i told her i had lost my sex drive half way through a make out session because i wa feeling a little ill and tired she constantly criticises my fashion choice and try to make me change my appearance gift i buy for her just get put in box and drawer in her room whilst i had to take picture to show her gift were on display she wa left a date because i forgot to put the plectrum she got me for our anniversary in my wallet when i do everything a she want she basically worship me but the moment i do anything wrong she blow up she threatens suicide before i can get out telling me i m the source of her happiness that she never want me to leave she s scooped out my happiness and independence and made a home for herself there i feel like i have stockholm syndrome because fuck every time she get angry i feel nothing but the compulsive urge to try and make her happy despite knowing that s not my responsibility most recently she bought me something a little expensive and something i had wanted for a long time i wa super grateful she d been far le aggressive with me and i thought she wa turning a corner i thought like so many of u do i could save her from herself she proceeded to get increasingly moody with me over the next few day then told me that she had discovered a letter i sent a friend and felt like i wa betraying her then yesterday she posted a photo of me with her gift on her social medium saying i don t appreciate her an amazing girlfriend she wa furious i hadn t posted photo of it told me that she didn t believe i had given my sister the present from her or told anyone that she had given me gift i called her out on humiliating me determined this time to get out and she started alluding to suicide again hooking me back in then she told me she doesn t believe i love her that i don t say it enough and that she doesn t want me going to random friend for help and instead only ask her for it i can t take it for much longer i feel so so stranded and trapped and scared i want out but i don t know how to it s our anniversary soon and i know she ll want to go away for it and i just can t face it i can t face spending so much time with her away from safety i d rather put myself in hospital she s placed the entire burden of her happiness on my shoulder and i m starting to reach my breaking point she s actively trying to isolate me and i can t take it and i know what i need to do and say but i can t i feel the word get stuck to my rib every damn time she s robbed me of my independence and self purpose i feel like all i exist for is to make her happy she keep asking me why i haven t introduced her to my family and i know deep down is because i know this is abuse i know what she is doing to me and i can t face the thought of her digging her root into my family she demand to be a part of every aspect of my life and is now making herself my entire life i don t know what to do and i m terrified of what i might do,1

my 31f husband 34m and i got into a terrible verbal fight and i don t know if we can come back from it we have often argued during our marriage of 7 year but resentment ha been building this year along with many stressor my father passed away at the beginning of 2019 husband wa laid off in april and had a very hard time finding another job at his new job i felt he wa becoming far too cozy with a secretary and it led to a lot of argument amp x200b yesterday we got into what should have been a minor disagreement instead it s like the floodgate of resentment on both our side opened and we both just escalated the fight amp x200b we ended up saying thing i don t think can be ever taken back i know i wa saying thing that i felt were true but had never really said i assume he wa doing the same some of the thing that were said amp x200b he told me i wa fat and always miserable and he wa far happier at work than at home around me i told him other men hit on me and obviously don t feel i m too fat and i told him he wasn t nearly hot enough to call me fat he told me that i wa lazy and boring and that anyone hitting on me wa probably just looking for a hook up and would quickly become turned off by my personality i told him that at least i didn t act inappropriately with other men because unlike him i am respectful of our marriage and quickly shut stuff down rather than flirting with the office slut he said at least she wa fun and kind and had a beautiful body so when he had to come home to me every night of course he flirted with her at work because she wa a nicer person than me and hotter than me i told him she could have him because he wa a boring lazy lover anyway and i m sure after she sampled his technique she would quickly lose interest he then told me he wa boring and lazy with me in bed because he found me gross and he s never been attracted to my body and he only ha sex with me when he really want to cum but he just want to get it over with quickly amp x200b i m ashamed of how we acted but the nasty soul crushing thing we said to each other i m guessing we can t come back from that right i can t imagine having sex with him again now is this something that we could work through in counselling or should we call it a day and move forward to separate amp x200b tldr after month of stress and resentment a mundane argument exploded into vicious verbal insult between my husband and i where we attacked each other s insecurity need to know if it s fixable,0

mentally and physically abused girlfriend 21f 24m so i don t really know where to start this but i suppose i should start by saying that my girlfriend most likely ex girlfriend now wa in an abusive relationship for 4 year and ha had a hard time recovering from it she would constantly tell me that i am so much different than her ex different in a good way because i treat her properly with respect and a much love a i can give however a good a i treat her she still go through these period of anger and depression and like to take it out on me normally it s no more than some verbal abuse telling me she s leaving me and that she doesn t love me etc but always apologizes once she ha calmed down and we work through it from there the time in between these episode have slowly gotten longer a time went on and she opened up to me a lot more about when she s feeling that way and that she doesn t mean any of what she say she say that she just get so angry and sad that she doesn t know how to cope with it and instead take her anger out on all the wrong people but again we work through it i really do love her but last night we went to a party where he ex happened to be and one of her best friend wa being buddy buddy with him and she saw this and got extremely upset now for the sake of context her friend know all about what her ex put her through so seeing them being friendly with each other had set her off her and her friend ended up getting into a screaming match outside and then it got physical myself and another separated the two of them and my girlfriend took off i obviously followed her to make sure she wa okay and then she turned her anger on me yelling at me and calling me all kind of name and i just simply kept asking what did i do for you to be treating me this way she couldn t give me an answer and instead turned and punched me in the face twice breaking my nose which started bleeding like crazy i then got a little angry but still i m not the type to ever put my hand on a woman or stoop so low a to calling her every name in the book and making her feel worse than she already doe so i just continued to ask her why she think she can treat me this way when i ve done nothing but try to help her and your anger is being directed at the wrong person she just proceeded to tell me that if i went back to our house that she would gut me and that if i were to try and sleep there that she would kill me in my sleep so when we got back to the house she started grabbing all of my stuff and trying to bring it to the front door to throw it outside so i had no choice but to call the police the police came arrested her charged her with domestic violence and a few others and took me down to the station for a statement we now a part of condition of the charge have a no contact and for myself to retrieve the rest of my belonging i ll need to set up a police escort i honestly just don t know what to do part of me feel terrible for having called the police on her when i know she really just need help and the other part of me feel like it wa justified because she did put her hand on me and wa pretty violent towards me when i ve done nothing wrong i m not really sure why i m even writing this maybe just for insight maybe advice but mainly i think it s just to get it out of my head and try to figure out where to go from here because at the end of the day i really do love this girl and i want the best for her but i don t think i could go through that again any reply is much appreciated thank you,1

my 22f boyfriend 25m 4 year won t stop making comment about my food apology for any typo i m mobile and frankly at my wit end my boyfriend and i met during my senior year of high school and his freshman year of college we started dating a year later and because of some scheduling stuff we actually wound up graduating the same year we both got job and moved in together over the past year or so that we ve been living together he s started making comment about food particularly dessert thing like do you really need that and just tonight he asked me why i wa getting one single cookie because it wa going to ruin the workout we have planned for saturday for reference i am not overweight far from it i have gained about 30 pound since we met but i am 5 9 and spent most of my life underweight i ve been hovering comfortably at 150 lb for the better part of a year now and while i m not stick skinny anymore i actually have a figure i kind of like it he on the other hand wa kind of chunky a a kid and is now just the teeniest tiniest bit overweight like literally just barely by 5 10 lb his immediate family is also rather overweight when we met he wa ripped but i actually kind of like him with a little fluff but if he s happier at a lower weight i love him that way too and he know all this because i tell him how sexy he is all the time but am always supportive of him eating how he want or going to the gym or whatever i ve tried asking him to stop i ve tried telling him to stop i ve asked if he want me to lose weight and he say he s concerned about my health so i asked him if he want to come to a doctor s appointment with me and he said no i ve flipped out about it twice now and always apologized because i am so fucking tired of having my food policed if i want one cookie i should have it if i want five cooky one day honestly who care i think he s projecting but i don t know how to make it stop and i really can t take it anymore we don t have sex because i feel like he s more critical of my heavier compared to when we met body how do i make him stop do i need to get more blunt set an ultimatum tell him we need couple counseling he s so funny and generally kind and we have so much in common he s been there for me through a lot of family trauma i want to marry him but this is a big problem for me tl dr i went from underweight to normal weight over the course of my 4 year relationship boyfriend ha been making shitty comment about me eating dessert for a little while now and i don t know what to do about it i m at the end of my rope,0

my boyfriend 39m ha a smart way of avoiding potential argument and it s starting to irritate me 31f my boyfriend ryan and i have been together for 8 month now most of everything ha been just so well and peaceful in our relationship that i couldn t be happier a a matter of fact i don t think i ve ever been this happy with anyone ever however in the 8 month that we ve been together we haven t had not one disagreement argument or fight i don t know if i should find this healthy in the consideration that we get a long and communicate so well or if i should be alarmed in the sense that i really don t know ryan outside the good of the relationship i love ryan i love everything he is and stand for how he interacts with me in making sure i know that i m special to him bla bla bla i mean it s all perfect and dandy i could go on and on but though i claim to love ryan do i really love ryan can i really claim to love someone who i don t know outside of the good that make u i don t know the ugly side of ryan nor can i possibly claim that we are strong a a couple if there aren t any thunderstorm to weather i ve always been told that healthy relationship come with healthy argument it s inevitable healthy argument help set boundary in feeling of trust which allows emotional expression without abuse help aid better communication between you and your partner creates comfort within the relationship therefore heightening a more emotional and intimate connection a better and stronger bond but what if there aren t any argument to obtain these positivity from here s the deal with ryan ryan is a very logical and rational talker thinker i ve seen him in minor confrontation with others where he is very surprisingly strategic when dealing with others in a potential sticky situation it s very intriguing to watch and though i can say we haven t had any real heated confrontation i cant say he doesn t do thing that upset or irritate me however he ha a much different approach with me when he know he s about to enter the red zone with me instead of talking to me about the thing he know i m upset about he point a subtle finger my direction for example for the last week i ve been planning on making one of my family dinner for him and his daughter over the weekend i ve been excited about it since i found the recipe and he seemed pretty enthusiastic about trying it the first night instead of me making it for dinner he ate two or three hour before dinner and then claimed that he wasn t hungry for dinner fine the second night i wa supposed to make it he decided to take him and his daughter to a huge late lunch while i wa at work and decided dinner wasn t necessary to cook when i got off because they had already eaten a late lunch and weren t hungry then today for lunch everyone wa hungry so i suggested that i make my dish for lunch he suggested something easier a it wa the weekend and his daughter usually get her picking of fast food on sunday it wa then that i realized that he really wasn t interested in trying this meal at all so it hurt my feeling in the sense that he made all these excuse not to have it instead of just telling me that he didn t want it so when i expressed to him that i felt disappointed and little hurt on the obvious hunch that he wasn t interested in trying it considering all the excuse he had not to he simply just blamed it on the fact that i couldn t make up my mind on when to make it not an actual fact or that his daughter just simply wanted something else so instead of working it out i allowed them to get their taco bell and i went home and made my dinner for myself and ate alone a his peace offering he made sure to get me more mild sauce packet for my taco stash right on nothing wa accomplished and he wa able to wipe it under the rug now i know he probably just want to avoid any potentially argument that roll our way especially since these little annoyance aren t worth really arguing about i know just a well a he doe i ll get over them but here s what i m afraid of these little annoyance that he feel like he can just so strategically wipe under the carpet using this or that could potentially roll up into a much bigger deal and a much bigger argument that we aren t prepared for a we just don t have any experience in them i want u to be strong a i do see myself with him for a long time but can we be strong enough to weather a storm that is long overdue tl dr my boyfriend and i haven t had one argument or fight since we ve been together i m annoyed that he avoids any possibility for one by deflecting not sure if this is normal,0
i thought he wa the one young dumb and in love that what i felt when i met him and just my time tall 6 5 athletic played h football and college soccer tan friendly and not afraid to share his feeling his mother had m and cancer when he asked me out i wa shocked but i accepted it the first two month were perfect always together and always in love but then it changed i noticed him in a bar fight but i just assumed it wa because he wa competitive and drunk he took it out on me i wa sobbing in the fetal position meanwhile he laid in his bed and fell asleep but his reputation wa so great i just told myself it wa probably a nightmare he started grabbing my wrist and pulling me towards him public or private i wasn t allowed to have friend unless they were with his crowd if i ever didn t want to oblige i wa beaten punched kicked slapped once he hit me with a muffin pan after i made him muffin for his birthday not only wa it burning hot but it felt a mark on me i ve always wanted to be tied up in bed but i didn t want to anymore but he found out somehow and tied me to the headboard and raped me it wasn t just once it happened half a dozen time and then he and his father ganged up on me saying i should even be lucky to be a part of their family i never left due to fear but i couldn t do it anymore i got enough courage one day to go to the cop they helped but when we went to court against the assault battery trauma abuse harassment and rape it wa just another he said she said he got nothing luckily i got a therapist who is amazing we don t live near each other but if we walk across he ll still try to taunt me we go to the same school it s gonna happen naturally last night he got hit by a car he is in critical condition and will likely die before sunday i feel so numb but to whoever wa driving that blue honda thank you,1
i 25m told my coworker 25f i wanted to sleep on the train and not talk she s now distant i m a pretty introverted person and i have a 1 hour commute on the train every day i use that time to read nap or decompress with my headphone in my coworker who joined u 2 montha ago now catch the same train line a me and at the same time too for about week it wa horrible because i saw her before work after work and during work because she wanted to leave together too and she make a lot of small talk i finally told her that train time wa my time to decompress and i didn t really like talking or interaction with anyone on the train i emphasized that this wa with everyone and not just her and even apologised she wa taken aback but said she understood and she either sits in another carriage or something because i haven t seen her on the train since if we leave at the same time she go to the bathroom first but she now pretty much avoids me all together if we are exiting the station she just walk slower if i try to make small talk in the office she shuts me down we are sitting next to each other for a project and apart from good morning and stuff about work we don t talk when i asked her to cover a piece of work for me because i needed to leave early for an appointment she said she couldn t but doe for other coworkers if i compliment her work all she say is thanks really bluntly but she s all bubbly with other coworkers people now think i have insulted or wa rude to her because she s so extroverted and organizes social stuff at work already and when anyone s asked her she keep saying it s nothing and she doesn t want to get into it now my coworkers are being a bit cooler towards me a well how do i handle this going forward tldr told coworker i don t like to talk on the train now she s being super cold towards me,0
i 25f got in a fight with my 25f friend because she didn t take care of my house and cat when she wa supposed to now we haven t talked for month and i miss her what should i do in spring of this year i left for 2 week to go see my friend abroad i needed somebody to come and live in my place to take care of my plant and my cat she wa my closest friend we have known each other since highschool when i asked her if she wanted to do it she immediately said yes and she wa super excited because she wa still living with her parent and for her living on her own for 2 week wa exactly what she needed she had a boyfriend who lived in a another country and every time he came to see her they rented an airbnb so she invited him to stay with her those 2 week in my place you see now it wa a perfect situation for her because they saved a lot of money of course i didn t ask money from them just to take care of stuff around the house one day before i left i invited her to my house and i gave her a list of stuff i wanted her to take care of and also some house rule i wrote everything down to be sure she would remember she wa full of joy and assured me she would be extra careful with everything another thing i asked her wa to take one of my cat to the veterinary because i had just noticed some problem on his skin and i couldn t take him myself because it wa sunday i told her she just have to take him there and do whatever the vet say and i would pay the bill when i came back the vet wa a 3 minute walk from my place so it wa no big deal she promised me to do so when i came back from my trip i found my place in a very bad condition everything wa messy and dirty my plant were dead my cat s skin desease wa getting worse there were piece of skin and hair missing from his body the fridge wa full of rotten food i had to throw away everything in there one of my pan wa destroyed while cleaning i found piece from a cardboard game behind the couch the cat bowl wa full of food i had asked her to feed them twice every day and give them a certain amount of food but she probably wa bored to do that and she gave them a mountain of food every time i also noticed that my cat had developed some new behavior like jumping on the kitchen counter or eating from plate stuff that i had trained them for month not to do i wa so shocked in the beginning that i didn t tell her anything i just asked her some question very friendly to see what she would respond i learned that one of the cat had peed outside of the litter box one time that mean the littler box wa too dirty because he never doe this if the sand is clean she had also forgotten the water heater on for 2 day at some point she also said that her boyfriend more or le took care of everything in the house she didn t seem to think anything wa wrong like a child then i went to the veterinary and he told me she brought the cat the first 2 day and she wa supposed to bring him every day for his treatment but she only showed up after a week this information made me mad so i confronted her i told her she messed up for me the worst thing wa that she didn t take my cat s health seriously she responded that she didn t take him to the vet the next day because she thouht it s no big deal and the cat wa doing better and she had to be somewhere else these day i got so angry i started shouting at her about how irresponsible she wa she cried and apologized and promised to call me the next day and help me out with th cat s treatment she never called it took one month of daily treatment for my cat to get back to normal the vet said it would be a matter of 1 week if she would take him there every day so the fact that she didn t allowed the sickness to spread on his skin to the point that he could actually loose some of it it s been 6 month now and i miss her apart from this whole situation we have been great friend and had a lot of fun together i realised she probably ha no concept of responsibility and taking care of sruff because she still life with her parent and she didn t understand how her action were wrong i am not angry anymore and i feel like we can be friend again but the fact that she hasn t called to make up for her mess is stopping me she is the one who should contact me but on the other hand it s the only fight we have had in 10 year of friendship so i don t know if it s enough to end the realtionship once and for all what do you think tldr my friend wa supposed to take care of my house plant and pet while i wa away and she did a terrible job it s been 6 month and i miss her do you think we can be friend again after this,0
my friend 35f just confronted me 35f about me not paying for her food hey everyone i had previously posted about a situation with a broke friend that ha been acting a bit shady when it come to money and i m finding myself in a really weird and awkward situation that i have no idea how to deal with the last time i saw my friend in a social setting wa at a brunch with a little over 20 people the brunch wa hosted by her friend whom i m acquainted with but not super close with it wa a casual cafe and some people ordered full brunch while others just ordered a coffee and something small i ordered a pastry and regular coffee total wa 4 50 and my friend ordered a full breakfast and a fancy 4 cappuccino total wa 16 50 the host wanted to pay via one check so the waitress wouldn t have to bring out a bunch of separate check i actually prefer getting separate check when i go out with friend but i also prefer to go with the flow especially in setting where i m not that close with everyone i didn t want to impose my preference especially when the host made it clear she wanted to do one check my friend suggested that i venmo her 6 to cover my pastry drink tax tip and that she would venmo her friend the host 26 she said this wa more convenient for the host rather than getting 20 separate payment she then kept announcing to everyone around u that we were paying together which i thought wa a bit weird before the bill came my friend left early to go to her nephew s birthday party she left without paying when the bill came i just venmo d the host 10 4 50 tip tax a few dollar extra in case we came up short the host asked if i wa paying for my friend a well at that moment it had clicked why she kept telling people we were paying together she had been scheming all along to leave someone else to pay for her food i responded i don t think so she said she would venmo you this is technically true a my friend originally said that she would venmo the host 26 for both of u the host looked pissed and didn t say anything else to me the people next to me also looked uncomfortable in hindsight i realized this wa because my friend had previously announced that we were paying together afterwards i felt crappy about the entire situation like i should ve covered for my friend somehow but to be real fu ing honest i didn t feel like paying 20 for someone who just put me in a really awkward position the way she did anyway i just met up with this friend who asked if i wanted to get lunch i wa wary but i sensed she needed to talk so i agreed to meet up with her however i did not order anything i just sipped on water this friend said she felt betrayed that i only paid for my food when she told everyone that we were paying together she asked me why i would do that and not have her back unbelievable i wa so speechless i didn t know what to say i told her that this wa on her a she is the one that left the restaurant without paying i told her i never agreed to pay for her i only agreed to let her pay for u together via venmo if i give her 6 she pointed out some of the nice thing i have and how i wa selfish because i am well off but i m not even willing to help out a friend with basic small necessity when i have all these nice thing i told her that friend don t put friend in awkward situation like she did i almost wanted to tell her that if she is having trouble paying for the basic necessity that is on her because she shouldn t be paying 1 000 a month for personal training session if she really is having that much trouble even paying for food i held my tongue and just told her that i wa done with this conversation and started getting my stuff to leave she spat out that i m not welcome to hang out with her friend and said i couldn t come to some upcoming holiday event her friend had invited me to i m new to town a i moved here for a job i m extremely introverted and quiet and don t get out to socialize much so i ve been on meetup to make new friend and stuff i do feel grateful she introduced me to her friend but i d rather have no friend than deal with a friend that expects me to pay for friendship i shrugged and said peace out and left i don t need people like her in my life although i don t know what i m supposed to say or do if i run into her friend and or if they text me do i just avoid them how do i diplomatically handle or talk about our fall out if anyone asks tl dr broke friend confronted me that i backstabbed her by not paying for her food when she left without paying her bill we are no longer friend and i am unsure of how to deal with potential awkward situation when i run into her friend or if they text me do i just avoid them if not what is the best way to handle potential future encounter with them,0

i 31f am the golden child sandwiched between two bipolar sibling 29m amp 33f and i feel like i can t ever have anything for myself because my life ha been constantly consumed by their crisis for the last decade sorry in advance for length i consider myself to have had a normal childhood my parent were divorced and mom wa a little stricter than i d have liked but on the whole we had a very average middle class upbringing however once my sibling got into their early twenty shit started going haywire multiple duis lost license crashed car alcohol addiction drug addiction and ruined family holiday later here i am here with a stable career and in a long term relationship and generally have good thing going for me i struggle a bit with social anxiety but on the whole i am in pretty ok shape it s not really a shock that my parent think of me a their golden child i am who they call when there is a crisis i feel like they lean on me very heavily for emotional support i think they sometimes feel like failure a parent and i am some glimmer of hope that they aren t both sibling when in a bad state can be very cruel and say hurtful thing and they know i never will do that they have both made comment about me being the one that take care of them in old age to be clear i have no intention of cutting out any family member i love my sibling and i love them despite whatever mistake they make but sometimes it feel like my whole life revolves around bouncing back and forth between their antic and then trying to get them back on their foot in the aftermath picking their phone from stranger when they drunkenly lose them getting them to and from place when they don t have their license mediating fight around the holiday etc right now my brother is having a meltdown because he drunkenly spilled a drink on his laptop destroying the album he s been working on for month i am basically on call in case he start threatening to kill himself my boyfriend and i eventually want to try living in other part of the country but i am scared the two of them will literally give my parent a stroke one day and that my parent will feel abandoned by me i know i will be resentful if i let my life pas me by and i feel like i have to live my life now because i am positive i will be the only one responsible enough to take care of them when they are older tldr both my sibling are bipolar and struggle with mental health which put a lot of strain on my parent who will do anything to keep them afloat my parent rely very heavily on me for emotional support and i don t know how to unpack the guilt i feel for wanting my own life sometimes,0

his response to me wanting to drop off our son at the sitter so i could go to my prenatal appointment and our pre dry wall meeting for the house we built ,1
after year of dealing with my 28f husband s 28m porn sex addiction i think i ve reached my limit is our relationship salvageable husband and i have been together for 5 year but only married since the summer we ve always had a fantastic and loving relationship overall but there there have been some instance that have come up throughout the relationship using a throwaway because of the content of the post long term lurker of this sub and would really appreciate your input when we first started dating but before we were exclusive he went away to his college town for a week though we d been talking daily up until this point he eventually went silent for the last few day of his trip i had a feeling that he wa hooking up with the person he d been seeing right before we met on the trip but because we were both still on tinder and hadn t had the talk i didn t bring it up a few month later after we had decided to see each other exclusively i asked if he d hooked up with anyone that week but he denied it he later admitted to spending time with and having sex with this person but not remembering the detail because he wa drunk i ll call her beth he continued talking to beth and met up with her twice a far a i know one time he travelled to her state to spend time with her and her friend and the group ended up going to a sex shop he told me about the trip but wa evasive about who wa with him another time he met her in his hometown and they went to dinner alone we were already exclusively dating at this point and he didn t tell me who he wa seeing that day only that he wa seeing his friend from college again i had a feeling that something wa off but i wanted to trust him so i didn t bring it up until a few month later when he finally admitted to all of the above he said that he wa just meeting with her a a friend and didn t want to tell me at the time because he didn t want it to ruin our relationship after that conversation he continued talking to beth but a far a i know didn t meet with her in person anymore thing settled down after this and we didn t have any major issue for a while however he d always had issue around sex and intimacy that we were actively working on when we first started dating he wa never able to ejaculate from having piv sex he wa a frequent masturbator masturbating multiple time a day and had some serious kink think extreme bdsm where he ha complete control over his sex partner but a we began exploring our relationship he opened up about his kink and we eventually figured out how to get him to finish throughout everything i tried to be a patient supportive and open minded with him a possible and wa down for anything that would help in the bedroom a lot of our sexual preference overlapped so we were making a lot of progress since thing were going so well we moved in together a few year ago we started talking about getting married eventually a well it wasn t a priority for me but his family is religious and they wanted u to be engaged if we were going to be living together he told them that we d be engaged soon after settling into our new place around this time we went to my friend s wedding together i d spent all morning getting ready spent on a blowout did my makeup dressed up and felt stunning he kept telling me how amazing i looked at the wedding though i noticed that when sitting at the table next to me he kept turning his head to look at someone else s girlfriend the first few time i just assumed i wa seeing thing but eventually it became very obvious we went outside and i asked him if he d been staring at other woman and he got quiet he first told me that he wa just staring at other people s shoe he ha a mild foot fetish and love woman in heel however we d been sitting at the table so it would ve been impossible for him to even see anyone s shoe then he then just apologized and said that he hadn t even noticed he wa doing it but would stop we went home and fought about how disrespectful he d been to myself and to the woman he d been staring at and how embarrassing it wa for me to bring him a my date and then to be surrounded by my friend while he wa leering at other woman he said that he hadn t thought it would be a problem because i wa so open about his other sexual quirk and that he d work on his self control the engagement wa put on hold while he attended therapy and we worked on rebuilding the trust and fixing the relationship by this time we d been living together for 6 month and still weren t engaged and his family wa putting pressure on u to finally commit he refused to tell them that we were dealing with issue so the tension wa a little high eventually we felt comfortable enough taking the next step and got engaged and obviously married there have been minor issue over the last few year him continuing to masturbate multiple time a day him casually browsing porn even when not masturbating and him following half naked woman on instagram but we worked through them for a most part i would get pang of paranoia and low self esteem but i ve been seeing a therapist to work on my trust issue which predate this relationship but that have been exacerbated by the little issue we ve had over the year then on the first day of our honeymoon i went to go take a nap before dinner when i woke up he wa asleep next to me so i took his phone to call home because mine wasn t working abroad when i unlocked his phone he had an incognito window open to the instagram sign in screen though i know he ha the app installed i woke him up and asked if he had a fake account and he admitted to creating one to follow instagram model and that he d tried logging in to browse it on the toilet but not to masturbate this again made me feel really gross and we had a long conversation about how i wasn t comfortable with him sneaking around to casually browse porn he said that he d stopped staring at woman in public but he wasn t aware that this would be upsetting to me and he again said that he d work on his self control i didn t want to ruin our honeymoon so i tried to move on and just enjoy the trip we didn t discus it afterward finally a few month ago my mother wa in the hospital and after a grueling few week of test it wa determined that she wa brain dead and would have to be taken off of life support i wa completely drained from the experience and wa a hysterical mess on the day she wa taken off life support i wa home waiting for a call from the hospital and husband wa working from home to support me i noticed at one point that he had some weird image up on his computer he ha a porn folder filled with photo of naked and half naked woman but because he wa supposed to be working i assumed that i wa just being paranoid i couldn t get it out of my head though so i asked him if he d scrolled through his porn recently and he said that he had that morning in the bathroom i confessed to freaking out about the image on his computer and he admitted that he did have his porn folder open and wa just scrolling through it absent mindedly he again told me that he hadn t thought about how it would affect me and that he d seek help though he hasn t yet this i think wa the final straw for me however my mother passed away later that day so i had to focus on processing those feeling it s been some time since my mother s death and i m now finally ready to get back to normal i don t know how i can though and what normal even look like anymore are these thing that can we worked through in therapy individual and or couple or is the relationship broken beyond repair at this point i ve tried to be a unbiased a possible above because at this point i don t even know what s acceptable or not honestly i can understand needing to masturbate i do it too and we ve always been very open about that aspect of our relationship because these example aren t even about masturbation though i feel so inadequate and a if i m not doing enough in the relationship that he need to be getting constant sexual stimulus from somewhere else i m also worried that he just ha an unhealthy relationship towards woman and sex in general thanks all tl dr husband ha a history of crossing boundary spending time with ex girlfriend and not telling me staring at other woman in public and casually browsing porn when we re home together and sometimes even in the same room most recently he sat 2 foot away from me scrolling through porn while i wa dealing with my mother s death can we work through these or is the relationship doomed,0

abusive message from my ex see the sign ,1
i 24f came home and overheard my boyfriend 26m saying rude thing about me to his friend so we have been dating for 4 year and just moved in together 6 month ago so far everything ha been really great we saved up for a long time to make sure we were stable before moving in and tried to make good decision for ourselves it s going amazing so far honestly we are stable happy and generally doing well some backstory to the layout of our house because it s important to the story it s a very tall and thin 3 story townhouse the front door is on the main floor all that s really down there is the laundry room and foyer with a coat closet the kitchen dining area a bathroom and a little sitting area is the main floor the top floor is our bedroom a bathroom a spare room that we use like a game room rec room with the couch big tv pool table mini bar etc if we have friend over or are having a small gathering or playing video game or generally having fun it normally happens in that room on the top floor so i went out for a dinner movie night with my best friend to celebrate her birthday we went back to her place afterwards to eat some cake and watch some movie and do face mask girl stuff because i wa planning on spending the whole evening with her my boyfriend decided to invite a bunch of his buddy over for beer and gaming perfect setup so i ended up coming home around 3 a m but i could see the light on on the top floor and all the car and truck along with street that belong to people that i know so i knew they were still up and going i wa still wide awake and excited to join them and drink a little best friend is sober so we didn t drink throught the night so i wa pretty happy to see this so i go in and head up to the kitchen to stick some leftover cake in the fridge i can hear music and laughter and general shenanigan upstairs so i m pretty sure they haven t heard me come home i called out hey guy from the kitchen but still nothing i head upstairs and the door to the game room is closed and there s lot of noise in there so i figured they still haven t heard me we have a cat that tends to get into the mini bar and knock bottle around so it s pretty normal to close the door i m not trying to be quiet or anything but i can tell they haven t heard me come in because usually my boyfriend pop out to say hello i change into my pyjama and go downstairs to grab a soda getting ready to head up there say hello make a drink and settle in for some game or watching them play pool or something just generally hang out so by the time i approached the door again the music had been turned down and the room wa pretty quiet i stopped to listen for a second because i could hear my boyfriend talking and i didn t want to interrupt the story and i wa curious about what he wa talking about so i decided just to linger for a second turn out he wa in the middle of telling a really detailed story about something really private and embarrassing that happened to me that week when we were being intimate his buddy were laughing so hard and chiming in with generally rude remark about their own partner he then continues to point out some flaw and quirk about my body and say thing like i just turn her around if i don t want to look at those teeth a his friend are dying laughing i m pretty average looking but i didn t realize he thought that apparently i look horrible enough to make fun of my heart pretty much sunk to my foot and i decided just to crawl into bed and cry his friend ended up going home shortly after and he wa sawing log on the couch in the game room shortly after i am so indescribably hurt and upset but i can t decide if i am being unfair to him for being so upset because i wa never intended to hear those thing he is normally really supportive of me and is always complimenting me and calling me beautiful and i wa just really shocked and hurt by that since it wasn t intended for me to hear do i just forget that i ve never had a situation like this before and he s my first boyfriend if i m being totally honest so i have no idea if i am just way over thinking this or if i m right to be upset i don t even know how to bring this up to him is it reasonable to be hurt over thing you weren t supposed to hear i have no idea how long he s thought those thing about me but i suddenly feel like he secretly think i m disgusting and it s probably going to leave is that a ridiculous thing to worry about should i drop it tl dr i came home but my boyfriend didn t realize and i overheard him telling embarrassing story and insulting my appearance to his friend,0
i m addicted i found myself backpedaling today on the 21st of september i kicked out and broke up with my mentally physically and sexually abusive fiancé but still even a i sit here and say out loud that he s manipulative mentally and physically abusive sexually abusive and extremely toxic all i yearn for is for him to love me the way i love him i took care of him in every aspect for 5 5 year and stayed through everything and still all i want is his love i get butterfly when he text me he want to be friend but i know i shouldn t it s so weird to be absolutely terrified both physically and emotionally of someone yet still all you want is to be with them or not with them really but the idea of them that you wish they were the fake person you think of in your head to make excuse for the garbage toxic person they really are,1
why am i so weak hello i need help i ve 25 been with my girlfriend 24 for just over a year it s cliche but she is the most amazing person i could ask for she wa always honest from the start about her pmdd for those not aware it s a very rare condition which effect 3 of woman and is like pm on steroid with the most extreme mood swing and the horrific anger but i ve always put up with it every month because i love her my girlfriend is suppose take a ssri for her pmdd she doesn t she very anti antidepressant which i still don t understand but i respect her choice she refuse to go back to the doctor she s doesn t want to be on pill i don t know why i myself wa on her same tablet for depression which is ironic so it s definitely no big deal to me but i ve been fully recovery for a couple of year now however over the last 2 month it ha got so much worse we have both had a lot of stress laterly both finishing are master degree and job hunting unfortunately she ha had a worse time than me but i ve always supported her i know i might sound like a mug but i did all her university work including dissertation for her i pay for holiday and treat her like a queen her behaviour ha been so out of control and i think she s taken her unhappiness on me she s had a go at me for everything from being selfish for not being able to afford a music festival both where jobless and i paid for a holiday and the grade she got in her work which i did because she struggled with she s mocked my family because my dad wasn t able to give her a job called me a embarrassment because i went to a protest ralley always brings up my ex and said they where lucky with out me say she wish she could of punched me in the face but it s not even the argument i ve been called everything from cancer disgusting evil spinless and a waste of a person but it s stuff like being called half a man that really hurt me i ve felt emasculated and crushed by the dig on everything from my appearance to my friend and it ha really got me down it s got to the stage where she blame for the anger when all i do is try and take a step back in an argument she blame me for making her angry but she will attack me everything it s got so normal for me i ve told her how much it s hurting me but nothing change at all but i am spineless i keep going back i feel drained and so shit i can t cope anymore with the constant argument and being verbally attacked i just want to know what is abuse is it abuse,1
tip think of them like a moody teenager or a stroppy toddler honestly while you re in the shit situation just think of them like a teenager or a toddler a lot of their freakish behaviour will make sense and sometimes even become humorous but obviously don t ever forget that they are being abusive this is just to help you manage and put up with their crap a little,1
struggling to come to term with an unusual trauma my relationship with my ex wa toxic in very very many way we broke up 3 year ago and i ve had a hell of a time processing it and feeling okay about myself again i dropped out of university and moved country for him so it wa very difficult building up a life again after leaving all of this wa hard but hard in a way that i can explain to people we fought a lot that relationship made u both miserable so we broke up i don t know if it wa abuse because he wa never outwardly aggressive towards me he didn t hit me threaten me with direct harm more sulked and withdrew affection when he didn t get his way but isn t this normal when people are upset called me name or said i wa dumb or anything clearly negative like that more acted in a way that i often interpreted a condescending and wa visibly frustrated when trying to teach me something or work with me on something the way i felt during and after our relationship though can only be described a trauma i lived in a state of disassociation for year i wasn t myself my self esteem wa non existent i lived in fear of something the tiniest thing could make me cry for hour because i wa always so on edge i once messed up a train s time and we got to the station a few hour earlier and that sent me into a day long complete panic since breaking up with him i m a different person i basically feel like myself again i m in a new relationship that is so so good for me and most of those emotionally unstable behaviour are gone or very much minimised actually the only thing that can trigger me in that way now are thing that remind me of how my ex used to act i can t pinpoint exactly what wa so traumatic about that relationship it wa just everything it wa the little thing it wa how i felt his complete disregard for me and my well being just in our day to day interaction because i can t say he did this to me and kind of prove that he wa horrible which i kind of believe he wa and i do kind of see myself a a victim though i wouldn t be brave enough to say that to anyone who knew him i find it difficult to really come to term with my past and allow myself to move on i still feel very strongly that what happened wa to a large degree my fault and that it mean i m le deserving of love than other people more messed up a worse person the strongest example i have of his behaviour that hurt me so much wa his attitude to high heel he had a heel fetish which i m okay with but never seemed very understanding of the fact that 1 i m just not personally into heel or the kind of fashion he thought wa sexy so i would never wear that stuff just for myself and every time i did it wa a a favour to him and 2 high heel fucking hurt he also liked tight generally impractical clothing and i wa effectively forbidden to go shopping without him he got upset every time i bought something without consulting him first so in the 4 year we were together i went from being a grungy hairy legged teenager to dressing all the time in glitzy designer clothes 5 inch heel thigh high boot etc that shit is uncomfortable for starter it is also wildly inadequate for most of the social situation i found myself in a i don t happen to live in a cocktail party in la so i wa going to book club at starbucks wearing a burberry leather jacket and peacock print jean because that wa the most casual outfit i had and it wasn t fun for people who are into brand and fashion of that type this might sound like the weirdest complaint but feeling forced to dress in a way that i would just never ever choose that didn t reflect who i am and what i like and that is physically very restricting i do believe it ha traumatised me and it s difficult that when i say this i don t think i can be easily and readily understood being made to walk around all day in 5 inch stiletto to the point where i feel like i m going to faint not being able to focus on conversation because i m in too much pain going to the supermarket in heel and feeling like everyone is staring at me the instability that made me feel so vulnerable it make me emotional to think about even now i eventually avoided leaving the house at all except for work because i knew that every time i did he would ask me to wear thing i didn t want to especially heel and if i said no he would sulk and we would fight sorry this ended up being a very long post i wa just wondering if anyone else here ha had an unusual experience of trauma and how that make you feel i can never feel like i m legitimately entitled to claim abuse and that just make it harder to be kind to myself about it to acknowledge my need to heal,1

stuck for month hi i m a 22 f and have been in what i think is an abusive relationship with a 21 m i ve wanted to write something about it for a while but haven t had the heart or the gut i guess i just don t want anyone to tell me what i already know but at the point i m at right now i just need to know if i really am this piece of shit i m portrayed to be i met him when i wa 21 and had just moved to a new city in my first apartment with my sister i had just gotten out of rehab but wa having a hard time staying sober he messaged me on instagram and agreed to sell me weed so we started talking and he eventually asked me on a date i am a pretty attractive woman for my age i mean i wouldn t say i m a model but i m not unattractive anyways i wa fresh out of rehab so finishing a boyfriend wa the last thing on my list to do list but some how he managed to convience me to date him i don t even know how it happens if wa so quick but eventually he managed to get me to delete all the guy in my phone and instagram he started telling me i could or couldn t go place started going through my phone started the passive constant criticizing of me like i literally could say i look cute today and he would go off on me about how vain i am and how i m a slut who just want attention every time i posted something on social medium he would mock me saying i just wanna get fucked and the only friend i have only wanna fuck me or fuck me over it eventually turned physical when i started standing up for myself or questioning his motif he started by pulling me to the ground from my hair then progressed to punching me in the leg and chest so you couldn t see he doesn t hit me to hurt me physically because i m a really strong girl and have had my as beat a lot and can take it he did it to humiliate me and this is the part that make me sick to my stomach he would purposely take me to sketchy area to shop or eat or go out so that if i fought or argued with him even if he wa provoking me he would leave me there with no money or a lot of the time no phone battery and i would have to wait in the cold until i could get ahold of one of my family memebers to call me an uber or for him to come back and make me promise to be good so i didn t have to be stuck in a bad situation one time he even took my shoe off my foot before he threw me out of the car and i had to get an uber with no shoe i m tired of calling my parent like a little bitch and asking for money or a ride because he fucked me over he stole my debit card recently and won t give it back because why would you need to buy anything without me he didn t start using my card with my money until a of late i work min wage and pay rent i barely have money for grocery but he doesn t mind taking however much of it he need for whatever he need he s ruining my life i can tell but i feel like i have no power over him i m dumb and gave him all this fucking power and now i can t find mine i hate myself i m so insecure i ve never felt this low in my life even through my two year alcohol problem i never got this sad i have no friend anymore my family is starting to pull away and it s even effecting my job due to the fact that almost everyday before my shift he start screaming at me about what a burden i am and how i m such a dumb as i don t know i guess i have to figure it out im working on an exit plan but am terrified due to his aggressive covert behavior i know the most dangerous time with a abusive person is when you leave and i know he willl come at me full force i am a very sensitive person and he can tear me down with just a few word i guess i m just asking for any advice or perspective thanks,1

i 20f have become friend with my stepmom 25f rather than seeing her a a parent my dad 41m is upset about that my dad is in his early 40 and his new wife is in her mid 20 i m a college student living at home i m pretty sure she got accidentally pregnant from a fling and that s how they ended up marrying i ve never had that outright confirmed but that s what i suspect it felt super weird at first she s closer to my age then my dad s i kept my distance at first even when she moved in i wa just trying to ignore the weirdness but over time i got to know her she seemed lonely sad that she and i didn t have more of a relationship she obviously missed her friend who she moved away from so i asked my friend in college if it would be weird to invite her out i thought she might appreciate some time where she didn t have to be mommy to a baby and could just hang out with other adult they said it wa worth a try so i invited her to a party it wa a mix of undergrad and grad school student plus a few recent alumnus and it wa a great time we both got quite drunk at that party and had one of our realest talk she opened up about not feeling ready for motherhood wanting to get along with me but not knowing how to approach it because it s not like sure could be a parent to me like she could be to a small kid but she still wanted u to be family of a sort turn out we both feel weird about having a stepmom stepchild relationship because we re close in age but we both wanted to support each other a family anyway and after that party we got closer i invited her out to more stuff she made friend with some of my friend we ve even gotten to a point where we sarcastically call each other stuff like moooom and ungrateful child when we re poking fun at each other but i guess our friendship and the stuff we do together is making some stress in the relationship between her and my dad i don t know too many detail but i ve overheard and picked up on some stuff he s mad she s drinking and smoking weed when she s breastfeeding later he s not happy she s going out so much and leaving him with the baby she s not happy he seems to want her to do most of the parenting stuff my dad say me down and had a talk with me yesterday saying that she s a mother now i can t just invite her to party with my college friend she s not a carefree student they re trying to build a life together and i need to treat her like a mother of a baby not a party friend i said my friend do a lot more than party and it s insulting to say otherwise he got frustrated with me for missing the point anyway i don t think she and i did anything wrong just trying to make the best of a weird situation but my dad obviously think differently and the whole thing is so weird i don t know what s normal or the right way to navigate it tldr i m relating to my dad s new wife like a friend rather than a mom not sure if i m making a mistake,0
update on boyfriend s mean sister if you haven t read the first post you can do so before i start i wanted to say thank you to everybody that gave me advice on how to handle the situation i really appreciate it so here is an update on the situation i took y alls advice and decided to just stop reaching out completely i didn t go over to their house for a few week and didn t talk to them at all i also went to my grandparent s house for thanksgiving instead of their house the night before i left i told my boyfriend everything i wa feeling about the entire situation and how i didn t feel supported by him and that it wa hurtful that he never stood up for me he finally understood and said he would say something to them so after thanksgiving he asked both girl to come over to our house while i wa still gone and talked to them for about 15 minute he actually recorded the entire conversation so i could hear everything he said because i said i wa worried he wouldn t take it seriously he told them that i have a lot of trauma that i am dealing with and them saying hurtful thing isn t okay he also reminded them of everything nice i ve done and how all i want in return is kindness back there wa a lot more but it s hard to summarize without boring everyone he said they both cried and were obviously embarrassed a few hour later the younger one texted me an apology and i said thank you and that i accepted it but i never heard from the older one i haven t seen them or spoken to them at all and now with christmas coming up i m worried it s going to be awkward especially because the day of christmas my boyfriend and i usually go over to their house to open gift together i texted them both in a group chat and asked if they wanted to get breakfast this weekend but i haven t gotten a text back even though both of them have posted on their snapchats i know they are probably embarrassed and don t want to see me or think i hate them or something but it ha to be dealt with at some point and since i m the oldest i figured i would reach out first it s just taking a lot since i m so shy and awkward and my boyfriend said they are just embarrassed about the whole thing but i m still really nervous if we do end up going to breakfast i ll post another update on how the entire thing go tl dr my boyfriend of 3 year 24 talked to his mean sister 14 17 and now thing are weird,0
my coworker 42f ha decided that i 35f chew too loudly the saga continues i wa overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from my last post thank you all for helping me see that my coworker amy is bat shit insane here s the latest in the saga when my bos came back from his business trip i spoke with him about her document he basically told me that since it s an open office we should all try to be respectful of each other and to keep the noise to a minimum so basically she s getting no chastisement whatsoever which is honestly what i expected amy s also started keeping a diary of what everyone else is doing which prevents her from doing her work she ha also written up a document about proper workplace etiquette and want u to sign it it s still in draft stage but she sent it out company wide for input it s laughable with rule like morning greeting should be kept to 1 sentence and no music podcasts to be played during task x task x is something we have played music during for 3 year amy went off on jen for eating at her desk and jen ha been a huge ball of nerve over it a she ha a history of anorexia jen left cry that day and ha stopped snacking completely in the office amy also went off on another coworker for taking a day off pto approved because her so got deployed because work is supposed to be more important than family according to amy work ha been fun to put it mildly a for me i ve been ignoring her bos ha also given all of u permission to work from home if need be which is helping amy s escalating her criticism of me to try to get some reaction out of me but i m doing my best to not let it get to me most recently i wa bitched out for sharing with the team a road closure alert the road in front of our building wa blocked from a downed tree everyone thanked me except amy who went on a long rant about why our bos didn t send that alert and how it wasn t my place to alert the company i gave her text the middle finger while sitting in my car which at least made me feel good if nothing else she added the bos to the text string too which wa funny because he wa out of the country again so how would he know about a road closure to text u it s just absurd i m hoping that hr see how hurtful her behavior is but i think it s going to take a long time for there to be some improvement i m doing some light job searching a well i don t want to have to jump ship but i will if amy s behavior continues any thought on how to make this all bearable tl dr co worker is escalating with her food log hr bos is useless,0

my sister 23f hasn t spoken to me 26f in a month because she owes me an apology the longer she let it go the more resentful i get is that fair what do i even say when she finally doe reach out last month my sister got into a disagreement with me over money i reached out asking for a favor and she told me she d do it if i repaid her for something she did for me back in february an art commission if it matter i had a record scratch moment it had been month how had it not come up before she wa very insistent that i must have forgotten and that she wa too awkward to bring it up before i vaguely remembered her refusing payment and said so she said and i quote well your memory is famously not great the fact is that you owe me money so i can t do anything for you until you pay me that definitely annoyed me but i didn t push it and sent her some money i wa still bothered by the whole exchange so i went back and found the text where we discussed the item she made and payment it wa rock solid proof that i wa right and even showed that i offered to pay her and that she explicitly refused after i sent screenshots to her i received my money back suddenly with no attached message she read the text i sent but hasn t responded historically she really hate to be emotionally kicked while she s down so i let it lie and didn t say anything more we talk all the time so i figured it wouldn t take long for her to come up with an apology a week went by then another week and another and another and now we re here i haven t reached out because in the past she s lashed out at me over situation she know she s in the wrong about if i point that out she take any possible criticism or suggestion for change personally if not presented gently enough which is something i ve known and accommodated my whole life i m tired of it but i know i can t change her the longer she go without talking to me the more resentful and annoyed i ve become over the situation i just want to come right out and tell her she s made this so much worse by not just sucking it up and getting the apology out of the way i want to tell her she s damaged our relationship and is continuing to damage it i wasn t mad at her when we were arguing but now i m mad that she doesn t seem to care that she hasn t seen or spoken to me in a month that s super weird for u we live in the same city and used to hang out a couple time a week now i can t imagine going back to that a a norm am i wrong for feeling a resentful a i do should i work on being more patient part of me think i need to just let it go and the other part say that i ve done that too many time in the past so of course she think this ll work again i wish there wa an easy way to sit her down and make her aware of how she s weakened our relationship and the step we can take to fix it without her taking it personally tonight is when i think it may come to a head there s an annual event for an organization we re both part of the type of thing you don t miss if you re a member i expect to see her and i have no earthly idea what to say to her other than what i outlined above snarky thing keep coming to mind but i want to actually say something helpful or healing that actually get through to her this isn t about rubbing it in that i wa right it s about getting her to see how she s shooting herself in the foot and ending what used to be a close sisterly relationship over her refusal to own up to a relatively small mistake tl dr sister did something wrong she seems to want to ignore me until i forget what happened but i want an apology is that fair to expect also i m probably going to see her tonight what should i say if i do,0

increasingly dangerous child cause anxiety and drive division we are four couple in our mid 40 s with individual and collective friendship spanning two decade we all met a student and in share house accommodation and have hung out over the year being part of one another s life over that time in various way such a going to each other s wedding travelling together hanging out at event and party at one another s home etc the friendship are both collective and individual and whilst there can be the usual minor disagreement and challenge there is a strong history and a lot of mutual respect whilst we all have distinct life and career we all face the standard middle class dilemma of our age such a juggling work recreation mortgage and life stress each of the couple ha 2 3 child aged between 7 and 11 year of age collectively there are nine kid these kid obviously see one another at our various ad hoc social gathering perhaps 4 6 time per year and play watch movie together and generally hang out one couple in the group we ll call them bob and christina have two child their oldest kate is 11 f kate is the oldest of all the collective child and tends to lead the kid pack at our social gathering due to her elder status physical size she is quite tall very physically able and generally demand a lot of attention to a greater or lesser degree when they hang out the younger kid in the pack tend to fall in line under her leadership kate hold particular influence over the younger girl each of the family kate is not well she ha myriad complex psychological challenge that are not easily defined that make her an extremely challenging child she is very smart diagnosed a being on some sort of spectrum impulsive extremely self centred constantly demand attention is disrespectful of her parent and authority and struggle with empathy this is well known over the year her parent in particular her mother have spent a small fortune on assessment strategy and medication she go to a remedial school ha regular programme and assessment etc outwardly she present a quite normal and she is capable of being friendly and nice but it doe not take long for those around her to realise that all is not 100 kate s destructive ability are increasingly impacting on the other child in the group there are various example that each parent could hold up but i will just use those of my own experience for various year she ha attended the birthday party of my daughter 9 the previous year kate stole one my child s birthday present to her credit six month after the event she admitted this a an olive branch she wa invited again a a birthday party guest but this time she decided to unwrap my daughter s birthday present and trashed her room spoiling her day more disturbingly the last three visit kate ha physically hurt my daughter these injury are ostensibly accidental and minor but have become too coincidental to ignore at our last gathering kate wa carrying and hugging a pet cat and when my daughter stood next to her she shoved it at her face the cat panicked and clawed my daughter below the eye i wa there at the time and i witnessed kate s deliberate action that contributed to this for me that wa a sign that an increasingly precocious kate ha real potential to harm my child kate bully her younger brother mercilessly including some quite disturbing thing including reportedly making him drink her urine our friendship group is quite open and communicative my experience of kate is reflected in the experience of the other parent we are all worried about kate s ability to influence and dominate and with kate approaching puberty there is a concern that she is gaining an increasing hold over the child group particularly the daughter who are both younger and more impressionable kate s lack of empathy mean that she can be particularly mean even when she ha a smile on her face and they are all playing normally a a friendship group we are all aware of the situation and have spoken generally with her parent about the challenge that kate face although we have been cautious not to be alarmist christina kate s mum is relatively open about the challenge of her child but she is also absolutely exhausted by them their second child is an insulin dependent diabetic so their parenting load is particularly demanding from what i can see bob kate s dad is in denial he is poorly emotionally equipped to deal with this he ha become a workaholic travel all the time and aside from reprimanding kate for misbehaviour he appears to have largely withdrawn from active parenting an increasingly independent kate now ha an ipad and is commonly left to her own device in her room she ha taken on a range of quite disturbing interest and fascination evidenced through disturbing drawing and writing somewhat age inappropriate youtube video etc which she show my child that i do not feel are appropriate for a child of 11 christina ha truly suffered in all of this and ha ended up on medication herself to cope with what must be incredibly hard circumstance the mum of the group try to engage with her but are increasingly unable to offer the support she need a they try to balance the friendship with the real emotional damage that kate is bringing about on their own child i suspect for self preservation purpose christina ha largely resigned herself to the probably negative fate of her daughter when i saw christina at a party last year and i inquired about how kate wa doing she gave the resigned response of oh kate is in a hopeless spiral of self destruction of herself and everything around her before moving quickly on to other topic myself and the dad of the group play squash once a week mostly a an excuse to drink beer together after the game we use occasion to talk about life challenge parenting etc we invite bob every week to join u and have pointed out to him that he and we need this time to hang out share story and be present for one another but bob rarely attends despite u opening the door and in some case leading the conversation bob is largely incapable of talking about family matter to u i get the feeling he ha a sense of shame about all of this his conservative parent declared that kate their granddaughter wa a product of the devil and sent to them a a punishment for not going to church despite their considerable effort for year kate s behaviour ha not improved it now feel like bob and christina have come to the end of the road when it come to parenting kate and have given up their child ha derailed their life in so many way and return little love or joy a parent we have taken it upon ourselves to explain to our own child than kate is not well and that they need to come to the adult if they in any way feel uncomfortable when they see her we have worked to remain friend and be inclusive for the last few year although now thing are becoming increasingly difficult kate inflicts a real emotional toll on our kid but we recognise that kate s parent need u a their social outlet a their life are tough we want to be there for them at the same time we are not professional counsellor and whilst we need to discus this matter we figure the last thing they need is concerned advice giver like ourselves who make non professional diagnosis and judgement i have experienced this and it is awful my wife and i went through ivf before having child it wa an terrible emotional roller coaster and one of the most difficult thing about it wa the well intentioned but non professional advice that many friend gave u to fall pregnant we were overwhelmed by these perspective when in fact science wa required and not judgement a such to keep the friendship we have all gritted our teeth and managed to keep it together until a few week ago one of the set of parent of whom the dad is christina s brother snapped kate s destructive behaviour towards his child at a family event where the other friend were not present eventually triggered his outburst which immediately ended the social gathering by their account thing could have been dealt with better but in the heat of the moment and a a consequence of the very real fear that kate generates for the wellbeing of their child his outburst reflected many of the thing that we all think that kate is a destructive force their perceived giving up of parenting in this case is problematic and that they we cannot continue to expose their kid to this situation all of u in the friendship group increasingly feel the same way we feel deeply for christina and bob they are awesome people and enrich our friendship and life no one s life are perfect but i would take my family and parenting problem any day over theirs how can this be resolved kate s behaviour alarm all of u threatens her family life and increasingly dominates the nature of our friendship a much a we try to be there for christina and bob they are so overwhelmed and resigned to the situation that it is a if they have given up i for one am not willing for kate to be unsupervised around my daughter a she ha real capacity to hurt her emotionally and or physically we all want the best for them and they need their friend but we and they are running out of road here tl dr close family friend child show sign of dangerous psychological tendency targeted towards our child this is stretching their parenting wellbeing and our collective friendship to breaking point,0

how can i 17f explain my extremely watery eye to a whole bunch of new people g day i m a 17 year old girl who s soon moving to a new city for uni this will be the first time i m moving out and i m going to be meeting a whole bunch of new people it turn out that i have hyperactive tear gland that make my eye water a lot i mean like not just get teary but with literal tear running down my face whenever i yawn when it s windy or cold outside when i m near onion fume etc most of the people i currently know have known me for most of my life and know about my watery eye but even then i sometimes get made fun of by other girl and even some guy i m worried that going into a new environment and meeting a lot of new people who are unaware of my sensitive eye might make fun of me or even bully me and might think of me a a freak i m not i m just a plain old teenager so my question is how can i talk about this to people who think i m cry when i m not like do i just give them a head up in our first conversation that i have watery eye or just wait for it to happen and clarify if asked right now if i meet new people i hardly mention it since they re not always people i m going to be around long term so odds are they won t even ever see tear in my eye but moving to a new city living with new people hanging out with new friend it s a bit intimidating and i don t know whether i should at least tell my new housemate that i have this issue up front or whether i should wait till they see me yawn and see a couple of teardrop fall from my eye and ask me why i m cry before i explain to them sorry if this sound very silly but i am a bit of an introvert and am not overly comfortable with people and am scared of being bullied any tip are appreciated thanks tl dr i m an introvert with watery eye who is moving to a new city how do i explain my watery eye to the new people i m going to inevitably meet without being awkward and without being laughed at,0
i just need to vent my verbally emotionally abusive relationship is now physically abusive a well i ve been with my boyfriend for about a year and a half now my lease wa ending and he owns a house so he invited me to move in with him very early on which i had a gut feeling that it wa too soon and not right but i moved in anyway i had two cat he s allergic so i gave them to my mother it wa heartbreaking and i regret that so much now at the time my commute to work wa only 15 minute but from his house it wa over an hour i sacrificed so much to move here and be with him and he did absolutely nothing i hired mover and had to pay them extra money to put my bed frame together because he just sat there watching that whole first week i saw him for maybe 30 minute a night because he played video game from the moment he came home from work until he went to bed we got into a horrible fight about it literally the first week i knew i had made a mistake but i felt like i made my bed and i need to lie in it it s what i deserve for moving in with someone i barely know over time i noticed that little thing would set him into a blind rage where i feared for my safety this began within the first month of me living here i had never been spoken to like that by anyone for stupid thing like accidentally breaking something of his while i wa cleaning his mess up he called call me thing like stupid cunt bitch etc he get in my face in a threatening way and just scream at me until he s literally frothing at the mouth he s broken my thing and prevented me from leaving more time than i can count he is 6 5 and 300 pound and i m 5 7 and 150 pound he s physically very intimidating even though to the rest of the world he s a goofy sweetheart and a gentle giant i scoff when i hear him described a this he s also first generation italian american so his mother ha always coddled him and actually belief he s her father reincarnated so not a lot of help on that front over time the screaming in my face and locking me in room started to give me these like surge of fight or flight survival instinct and rather than cower on the floor hyperventilating i began to try to defend myself by pushing kicking him away he didn t like this at all he would throw me on the ground or bed and cock his fist back and beg me to hit him so he could beat my as he would pull my hair so hard and put his hand around my throat but not actually squeeze it wa like he did everything but hit me in the face at first he would be apologetic but then after a few day went by it wa my fault because i hit him first this brings me to the incident this weekend there wa a big parade in my city this weekend where lot of drinking is encouraged i ve struggled with alcohol abuse since my teen and have been drinking le lately to the point of almost complete abstinence which i m very proud of he say i m lying about it and secretly drinking and also call me a disgusting alcoholic at least twice a week anyway i wa allowed to drink this weekend since it wa the parade there were thousand of people there and he left me with stranger we had met to use the bathroom about 40 minute go by and the people we met are asking me where my boyfriend is i go to pull out my phone and i realize he took my phone i have an anxiety disorder and began to freak out and walked away to try and find him i gave up after like 20 minute and just sat on the curb cry he eventually found me and honestly it s kind of blurry from this point on he wa really drunk and so wa i we got back to the car and he wa screaming at me and being scary so i punched him in his face and told him to leave me the fuck alone i m ashamed of this he then grabbed me by my hair so hard i thought he wa going to either pull it out or bash my head into the gear shift the window of the car were open and i will never forget some random girl screaming do you see what he s doing to her someone stop him and he sped away it s been almost two day and i still feel where he grabbed my hair and it feel like a bruise he had no mark on him at all and barely flinched when i hit him i stayed in a hotel that night with my dog and came back yesterday i had the worst hangover of my life and just wanted to die he took care of me by giving me gatorade and apologizing before the day wa even over his apology turned into you started it because you hit me first we re equally to blame i honestly don t see it that way it wa wrong of me to hit him and i am embarrassed that i did at the same time i ve endured month of this shit and i wa drunk and fed up he s absolutely terrifying and i just reacted not only doe he now hit me and verbally abuse me but he s also a porn addict and doe cocaine pretty frequently he also ha gained about 50 pound since we got together but tell me that i m not sexy when he can t keep an erection because he can t stop jerking off i feel worthless and honestly think about suicide every day although i am too afraid of death and couldn t do that to my mother so i won t i told her everything and now my mother is terrified for me she s 65 year old and i feel so much guilt i m in graduate school so i have no money which he hold over my head constantly my mom want me to move out and said she would pay for it but she doesn t have much money and this is my mess that i made for myself i m tired of cry and i m so scared of him i will probably be posting here more often a i figure out what i m going to do i m cry now i don t deserve this when all i do is love him and take care of him i just keep rubbing my head and bursting into tear,1

i 28 m found out that my fiancee 27 f and her family disowned her younger sister 23 f for getting cochlear implant i ve been together with my fiancee for four year and we are currently set to get married this summer i have trouble thinking of any major issue we have had in our time together prior to this incident and we have lived together during very personal stressful time grad school and a cancer scare on my end so i think that meant something she is adopted and i thought her family 54 m 53 f 24 m 22 m wa wonderful i don t have a family and hers wa incredibly welcoming to me and seemed like fantastic people her and all her sibling are adopted two from the same family and all are deaf including parent they consider themselves part of the deaf community and it is very important to them i suffer from moderate hearing loss i received a an adult following a traumatic brain injury and she is deaf we actually met shortly after i first lost my hearing and wa still dealing with the adjustment and she helped me a lot during the transition last weekend her and i visited her home for the weekend and she went a day earlier than me when i came the next day i instantly noticed that everyone there wa in a horrible mood i asked my fiancee why and she told me that her sister had tried visiting the day before she had mentioned that she had a younger sister who she hadn t seen for five year who the family didn t have contact with she never went into detail about it and i interpreted the situation with the small info i got that her sister wa a drug addict who refused to get better this wasn t the case the day after my fiancee gave me a clearer picture of the story basically her sister expressed interest in getting cochlear implant and the family shut her down on it and she went ahead and began the process herself when she turned eighteen and the family my fiancee included decided that they were no longer going to consider her part of the family or speak to her when she came to visit and try to fix thing they shut her out again i knew that her and her family were generally not fond of cochlear implant but not to this degree long story short i m absolutely disgusted with this behavior and i have no idea how to respond i did a pretty bad job of hiding how repulsed i wa by this and how much it threw me off and i left early after making a bad excuse that i needed to leave i understand that the implant themselves are a contentious issue to the dc and even though i disagree i can understand the viewpoint and see it a legitimate but to do what they did literally make me want to vomit she ha zero regret over her choice i feel like i have no idea who she or her family is anymore if we had a kid did something she disagreed with would she disown them like this it s so callous i literally have trouble saying that i feel any love for her at all right now she called me multiple time trying to soften the story up i think she expected me to take her side and make herself seem better but it still sound awful even with her prettying it up how could it not tl dr my deaf fiancee and her family disowned her younger sister who tried to get and eventually got but after the fact cochlear implant they don t regret it at all and it s such a horrible mark on her character i m seriously considering calling off the marriage and ending our relationship,0
i 29f broke my husband s 30m heart by threatening to move out for a bit until he stepped up with the housework he s been holding on to that anger and pushing me away for 3 month without explanation i threatened to leave go stay in a hotel for a bit my husband this summer because he wa not taking care of housework or fulfilling small promise he made we fixed that issue or so i thought and then thing went on but i started to feel really disconnected from him and i figured it s because his job schedule changed and now we only see each other a few day a week for anything longer than an hour however he started intentionally avoiding coming home when i wa home or making sure we weren t alone at home togetherness for long period of time i called him on it and had a mini break down about how he wa not giving me his focus and time and he just said he wa sorry and he d try to work on it nothing changed and i kept feeling awful and then we had a blow up about cleaning up one of the dog s mess yes i know a stupid thing to blow up about and it started coming out that i broke his heart by saying i wa going to leave him and he still hasn t forgiven me gotten over that i also apparently joked about him not being smart enough to do something in front of his friend and he took it a me being serious that alone make me think there is a massive breakdown in trust in our relationship that he would think i would be serious about something like that but he held on to that for two week without telling me it had hurt his feeling so we have a pattern of him being hurt and not telling me for month on end and holding on to it and intentionally distancing himself from me while refusing to tell me why i am in no way shape or form blameless in this a i allow small stuff like housework to get me pissed off how do we fix this we don t have money to see a therapist right now tldr i broke the husband s heart and he hasn t been communicating with me about it and ha instead chosen to intentionally push me away,0

my husband 30m is upset by my 26f new friendship with my transgender coworker i ve been working at my current job for about 2 year and about a year ago one my coworkers opened up about starting the process of transitioning from male to female during this time she began asking everyone to start using her preferred pronoun and her new name of choice let s just call her nikki everyone at work wa incredibly supportive and excited for her at this point i wa still newer and trying to make connection myself and a few of u decided to go get our nail done around valentine day with nikki i ended up having to bail due to a migraine but i let nikki know that i would be so excited to hangout whenever our schedule would allow fast forward several month i had to call out of work due to food poisoning and nikki randomly messaged me on facebook telling me she missed my smiling face we chated a little and caught up i let my husband know i wa chatting with nikki and he commented that it wa random that she just reached out of the blue and i said that it wa a little random but we knew each other from work and she wa just trying to establish different female relationship a little background my husband and i were both cheated on prior to getting together so trust is something we both have been working on throughout our relationship so in an effort to continue to maintain trust i let him read our conversation he wa upset about how personal our conversation wa he said that we were sharing too much information he wa referring to a section where nikki wa talking about how she had wished her whole life that she would wake up one day and be a girl and i had related and said that i had always wished to wake up skinny so people would stop making fun of me he wa upset because i have always been a friendly person and at some point have overshared to make people feel comfortable he said that when i overshare sometimes people can get the wrong idea and think i m interested in more than friendship he cited how nikki wa calling me hon and saying that it wa too much i told him the nikki know i m happily married and nothing about our conversation wa misleading or oversharing the fact that she can be open and honest about her past is healthy and being able to find point to relate on can make people feel like they re not alone he continued to be upset and feel uncomfortable and the more i asked he stated that it wa because while nikki is on female hormone she still ha a penis i again assured him that our relationship wa platonic there wa no flirting and we are just friend i told him that i would still be talking to nikki but i would make sure that what i said wa not over the top today he asked if i wa talking to nikki and i said no but i had yesterday he immediately got up and stopped talking to me turned around and left the room i asked him to come back and talk to me and he said no and ha been ignoring me ever since i m frustrated i understand that this is a different situation but i want to be supportive of my coworker and get to know her there is nothing sexual about relationship and i don t really know how else to reassure my husband other than not talking to nikki tl dr my husband is upset about my new friendship with my transgender mtof coworker because he think we re talking too much and the fact that she still ha a penis i don t know how to reassure him that our friendship is and will continue to be platonic,0

saying no to sex is still scary and i hate it currently sitting in my living room alone trying to calm down i left my abusive ex almost a year and a half ago and have been with an absolutely amazing guy for about 7 month now just now we were cuddling in bed and kissing he made a move and i said i m not really horny rn my ex always used to get angry if i turned down sex now my boyfriend just said okay i ll just hug you and stroke your back then and it wa so nice but i still got anxious for no reason later he touched my boob a little and we kissed passionately i didn t tell him to stop and it felt nice but i just couldn t i wanted sex but at the same time i wa repulsed just by the idea i told him eventually that it s still a no and it wa totally fine we just snuggled a bit more and he wasn t annoyed or showed frustration at all it could ve been so nice to just snuggle but i couldn t enjoy it got up eventually and had a smoke i just fucking hate that my ex continues to have an effect on this relationship when it all could be so nice,1

i 23f don t know if i can continue to have a relationship with my sister 18f after this i m so sorry for the long post but i think the background is necessary thank you very much for reading and for any advice a few day ago i received a call from my aunt that my grandmother ha cancer with only a few month to live i went to visit my grandmother in the hospital the next day with my youngest sister 10f my middle sister 18f refused to come with she said that family a in my mother s side of the family made her uncomfortable this isn t the first time she refused to see my grandparent she hasn t seen them for the past few year despite them constantly asking how she is and why she isn t there i keep making excuse for her because i couldn t bear to tell them that she just doesn t like or care about them my sister wa never close to my grandparent like i wa grandma wa the only adult in my life that cared about me and believed in me so she wa my everything back then but i haven t contacted her at all in the past year due to an ongoing cps case i reported against my mother regarding my youngest sister 10f my grandfather whom my grandmother always sided with no matter what decided to cut u my mother and my sister and i completely out of his life because all this drama wa taking a toll on him but we decided to let it all go and put my grandmother s interest first grandpa said that grandma want everyone to be united and at peace and i wa willing to do that ever since the cps thing i wa seen a the traitor in that side of the family everyone thought i wa despicable for turning against my own mother but still i showed up and faced those people i talked to my mother despite feeling uncomfortable even my partner whose life my mother literally tried to destroy wa willing to make up with her for the good of everyone else especially for me when i saw grandma we didn t get to talk much but for the little we did talk about she wa asking a lot about my sister how s her health how s school where is she going to college my heart broke i know she probably didn t ask me why she didn t come because she knew the answer i tried to talk to my sister again i asked if she can please come visit grandma just once because this is the last time she ll ever get to see her but a blunt no wa all i got i asked her why she said she know grandma mean a lot to me but grandma meant nothing to her i told her grandma never did anything wrong to her like i know they aren t close but this person is dying and seeing her would mean so much why can t she do that one simple thing her response what s the point i started cry can you at least do it for me no answer just silence i wa really hurt i really feel like i meant nothing to her and that everything i did for her meant nothing i never asked her for a favor before and this wa all i asked for just see grandma for 5 minute she doesn t even have to talk to her like literally just stand there maybe hold her hand and that s it my father talked to her my youngest sister talked to her and ended up in tear she wouldn t budge she claim grandma is just a stranger to her dad told her to picture herself in grandma s shoe and someone she love doesn t show up how would she feel her response screw those people then am i wrong for thinking she is being incredibly selfish and even cold and heartless i know grandma is a stranger to her but can t she make her happy by seeing her for just 5 minute she is literally dying and this one action could mean so much to her is that really that much to ask for am i the crazy one this isn t the first time she s being selfish the last time she threw a tantrum literally sitting on the kitchen floor punching and slapping the floor and intensely throwing a penny against it because she refused to go to therapy the therapy wa court ordered and not going meant risking her and our youngest sister s placement with me it took a lot of convincing from my father to finally get her to go i tried to talk to my father about my sister s behavior how i m actually also worried for her anytime she s uncomfortable with something she would literally do anything to avoid it even if it mean suffering more in the long term the worst part she is 18 and she still need him to prepare her food put it on a plate place it in front of her and tell her to eat but he didn t say anything i wa met with the same silence am i overreacting that i think that this is the final straw i can t even look at her without feeling pissed off and hurt i can t even stand living with her now and i have really tried to help her become more independent but it s so hard when my father is still enabling that behavior and now i just want to give up it s not like my help is appreciated anyway i ve been cry on off the past few day and overridden with so much thought it s like i m not just losing my grandmother but i m losing my sister too amp x200b tl dr my sister refuse to visit our dying grandmother no matter what she doesn t seem to care how anyone else is feeling this isn t the first time i don t know if i can continue to have a relationship with her from now on,0

update me 22f and my partner 25m are taking a break from having sex original post so that didn t fucking work out i wa really blind and in denial when i wrote that last post i 22f wa seeing this guy 25m for three month until i decided i needed to end thing i wanted a relationship while he wouldn t give me a straight answer saying i m not ready stringing me along because it wa convenient for him i felt way more committed to our relationship than he did he wa the first guy i ever slept with and our relationship became very sexual he referred to u a fwb when i asked what we were at one point which bothered me which maybe that is what we were he wa so sweet when we first started talking and roped me in but once we started having sex it wa like something changed i feel like i rushed it because i wa so anxious to lose my virginity he said that having sex early on confused thing which hurt because i thought he knew what my true feeling were he wouldn t text me good morning towards the end or ask how i wa compared to the start i always made thing easier for him made time for him worked with his schedule drove to his place once i voiced my concern about how i felt very unappreciated and a little hurt he changed he didn t want to discus it when i initially brought it up and eventually we talked about it because i had to ask if he had time to process it he had a tendency to redirect serious conversation we decided to not focus on sex a much but he no longer saw me a a priority and became very distant he made me feel worthless because every time i texted him i got one word response or he wa just rude i think he wanted me to just stop responding so he wouldn t have to actually end thing with me i m so mad at myself that i forgot my self worth and how i let him treat me like shit i ended up deciding i didn t deserve to be treated like that and he obviously didn t want a relationship with me so it wasn t healthy to stay with him he say that he didn t just want to fuck me but his action said something different in the end once i actually found the confidence to voice my need and concern it didn t seem he wanted to deal with me anymore didn t genuinely feel affection only sexual towards me anymore he apologized for how it had to end this way and for being immature and said he hoped i didn t hate him after i ended it i put certain social medium s on private that i considered a little more personal and unfriended him and later found out he blocked me on everything don t know if he blocked my number but i guess it doesn t matter i hate that i feel so hurt over it even though he turned out to be an asshole i wish he knew how hurt i felt over everything there were some red flag i should have paid more attention to this whole thing ha been a learning experience and i just want to feel happy again don t know the point of this post other than just getting all this out part of me hope he feel a loss in this but i doubt it i feel stupid for being so hurt even though it s only been three month we would text every day see each other once a week sometime twice he became my best friend in a way and i m so sad it had to end like this blessing in disguise i hope tldr took a break from sex he didn t make time for me wa rude and uninterested distant so i ended it,0
should i 27f delete my boyfriend 31m from social medium tl dr my boyfriend used to post so much about me in social medium and he stopped a few month ago i am pretty sure he is ashamed of me now i debate if i should delete him to stop it from affecting my self esteem i know how immature this is going to sound i know a lot of you will probably think this is not a problem at all but i want to hear some advice because i think this is beyond social medium when i started dating my boyfriend he seemed incredibly involved and super proud to have found me thing moved super fast and he wa introducing me to his friend and posting me on social medium constantly i felt appreciated and like someone wa finally proud of dating me and show me off my boyfriend is someone who is flirty and constantly making comment about other girl is caused me a lot of self esteem issue because i feel like i am not good enough he also talk to girl and bartender constantly make joke about cheating and is in communication with people who want to date him one of his friend who admitted this to me he always say is just friendly but it is gotten to a point where i am not sure i can trust him enter social medium month ago he abruptly stopped posting about me or making reference to me at all this is a guy who is super active in social medium and ha a few account i have tried to bring it up in a calm way but it always end up with him dismissing me i have decided the best thing for me maybe to unfriend him everywhere and stop overthinking our relationship but i feel silly doing that so i want advice,0
possessive girlfriend normally i just chill on reddit to read conspiracy theory and talk about stupid stuff like that but i thought i d reach out here because i m king of losing it me and my husband are poly and are dating another woman together she is equal partner in our relationship we re both with her and she s with both of u me and my husband live together but she is long distance currently living elsewhere to try and find a job in her dream town we met two year ago there have been problem since the beginning but it s just kind of gotten worse and worse and snowballed over time we first started noticing that she wa particularly possessive of my husband she made demand on his time and would even get angry when we would so much a go shopping or go to a doctor s appointment without telling her beforehand basically if he wasn t around to text her or chat with her on skype she would lose her mind we thought that this had something to do with the relationship she d gotten out of previously it wa an abusive relationship and we know that her partner treated her very unfairly often did not tend to her physical or emotional need and just in general wa a really really bad partner to her for the first little while that we were dating she didn t even seem to register me a a person in our relationship she hardly ever talked to me despite dating me and had a laser focus on my husband and treated him pretty unfairly most of the time by making wildly unrealistic demand of him that he never leave the house or go offline without telling her etc etc she would say that if he really loved her he would want to spend all of his time hanging out with her every chance he could basically and she would get irrationally upset to find out that we had spent any time together me and my husband even if it wa just a shopping trip a drive or just sitting together at dinner cut to now a year into dating her and she is still doing all of this and then some she and i are closer now because i ve made effort to talk to her and i seem to be able to reason with her often in a way that my husband can t i think because we are both woman from similar background but my husband sort of get fed up with her behavior sometimes i say this but i have on occasion gotten angry at her a well for her behavior but mostly it just make me tired and sad recently she keep threatening to break up with u if she doesn t get her way over very trivial thing sometimes last night there wa a bad ice storm that blew in and our power went out for awhile we tried texting her last night but the storm wa affecting everything so nothing wa going through we live high in the mountain she said goodnight on skype but we didn t see it until the power came back on about forty minute later at which point we said goodnight a soon a we did she immediately laid into u about how much we hate her and how little she must mean to u if we couldn t even bother saying goodnight to her before we ran off together even after we told her the power went out after we got through to her about that she said she wanted to lay out some ground rule because she felt like we were lying to her about the storm in order to spend more time together than we should be it ended up snowballing into a huge 6 hour long conversation and argument between mainly she and my husband because once again she wa hyperfocused on his action in this situation while completely dismissing me from any of it and even forgiving me and it turned into a whole thing about how he obviously didn t value their relationship hated her and that he must really feel like it s a chore to be around her because he s so eager to spend time with me when something happens eg the power going out during the conversation she kept repeatedly denying thing she had said not but minute prior telling my husband he wa wrong about what she said even though we had physical chat log in skype we asked her why she wa so upset when we spend time together and right after saying she wa upset about it she denied being upset about it then she tried to blame it on me that she wa even having this conversation in the first place because in the past i have encouraged her to be open and honest about her feeling but i never intended her to insult him for five hour with that statement by the end of the conversation my husband told her how he felt how he really felt about how she s been treating him and then she said she wa sorry and maybe it all could have been avoided if she had just thought about it a little bit more before getting so angry at u both because clearly there had been circumstance preventing u from contacting her she said that she wa being unreasonable and that she wa going to bed so far she hasn t said a word to either of u since last night she always blow up toss around wild accusation name calling etc and by the end of the conversation say i know i wa wrong i m sorry but then doe the whole thing over again two week later it wa especially weird yesterday because we had had a lot of free time this week and ended up spending about four day glued to our computer to give her a much attention a possible because she s been stressed at work and the second we couldn t respond she flipped her lid i don t know why it s always so laser focused on my husband i ve asked her before and she say that he feel distant to her like she ha to fight to get his attention which is directly contradictory to reality but that she and i feel okay because i m almost always around to listen to her and i m just nice to be around except when she doe blow up suddenly i m the problem because he s spending all his time with me he doesn t we both work we re both very independent and have lot of friend and life outside of each other we only have one date night a week she just really seems to be jealous of the two of u but i m not even sure if that s what it is i am always an afterthought to her i seem to just be a source of her problem and yet removed from it at the same time because she also confides a lot in me when we are not arguing but a soon a she is angry about something she turn on a dime and say really mean and hurtful thing we suspect she may have bpd or npd and this may be the source of some of this but she basically refuse to go to therapy see a doctor or do anything about it my husband feel like she can change given enough patience and i hope she can too but i m honestly so tired of how thing keep going i m tired of her threatening to break up with u just because we didn t return a text message,1
partner go on a long business trip and exonerates himself from shared household duty and expense my 25f boyfriend 28m and i have been together for two and half year living together for two of those between u we have two cat and a dog we got the dog together but we have discussed that should we break up the dog would go with me along these line we are both engineer and sometimes practicality ha come at the expense of partnership he travel for long period of time for work the latest is two month internationally i m watching our pet his car taking care of our home etc we don t have parking at our place just free street parking yesterday his car got a 60 ticket i haven t moved it in a week and some temporary street cleaning sign went up that i missed i use the back door during the work week to transit and he wa parked out front we both make enough that 60 is not very impactful for either of u to absorb we spend that much each on a friday night dinner out but we re both cheap and nobody like a 60 ticket i told him about the ticket and offered to split it with him in my mind 30 for two month of parking in our city is not very much and splitting it is more of a gesture that to me say i took step to take care of thing for you but i messed up once you pay half to thank me for taking care of your pet and house for two month i pay half since my negligence caused it i can see the argument where i should pay the whole thing i considered paying it and saying nothing he reacted very negatively he think i should pay the whole thing fine i can see that argument he then used this a an opportunity to tell me that he think he shouldn t pay half the utility from these two month he also called me irresponsible and said that he clearly can t rely on me i find this pretty mean and that this whole thing just scream to me that we are roommate above partner his cat is more destructive than mine and having two cat and a dog to be 100 responsible for is a lot i feel like he isn t giving me any credit for taking care of the pet and household a well a just the act of living alone for two month without really any say in it i agree our job come first but this is tough for me and i feel like him saying he shouldn t pay half of utility is just completely discrediting any burden on me i can put the ticket aside and accept fault on that but tearing me down for it and launching into an argument that he isn t responsible for other bill while he s gone seems like he s just looking at this all a a business arrangement did i start that by looking at the ticket a a business arrangement am i being too sensitive should i be paying for everything ticket and utility am i living with a roommate not a partner tldr my boyfriend leaf town for work for two month leaving me with our shared pet and household responsibility at my own fault his car got a ticket and i offered to pay half in a gesture that while it s my fault i ve still done a lot for him the past two month he say i should pay the full ticket and the majority of our utility bill for the past two month i m questioning how indicative this is of our relationship am i roommate and not a partner,0

i think my past abusive relationship ha made me toxic and could possibly jeopardize my current relationship about two year ago i 19f wa seeing this guy 20m from the beginning i knew he had some family issue but i stayed around hoping i could fix him month in we were only hanging out with his friend and he distanced me from everyone including my family he then started being verbally abusive even in front of his friend and they would remain silent and sometimes even side with him a the relationship grew so did his aggression he started putting his hand on me in front of his friend even once in front of his house where his family viewed the footage away from home on the home surveillance one scenario that i will never get over is one night we were arguing in front of his aunt s apartment and he snatched my brand new phone out of my hand and threw it he shattered the whole screen if that wasn t enough he dragged me out of my car and threw me against the stair hitting me finally he chocked me to a point that i thought i d die after that argument thing never were the same i finally got the nerve to leave however even after leaving him and moving away he constantly texted me and threatened to expose my nude and personal information i d disclosed to him throughout our relationship i finally threatened to report him and blocked him i haven t heard from him since about 3 6 month later i met my current boyfriend 25m he wa the first person i really opened up to about my past relationship he treat me so well we ve been dating for about a year now he is calm and teach me how to grow within an argument with your so however i have been really struggling with my tone and learning to stop being triggered by every inconvenience i m starting to think my past toxic relationship ha traumatized me and in a way i feel a though i unintentionally picked up on the behavior of my ex not physical abuse but verbal i really love my boyfriend and i know he is the best for me and ha helped me grow so much within this year how do i help myself to help him i don t want to lose him,1

my 34f recovering alcoholic husband 35m snuck a beer and i need a sanity check hi folk long time lurker first time poster but i d really love some objective advice from stranger a weird a that may sound i will try to keep this a brief a possible but there s a lot of background so please bear with me my husband and i have been married for 8 year he s always been a drinker we both are we always enjoyed getting drink and doing social thing involving alcohol but in the past couple of year he started drinking more and more to the point where at the beginning of this year we had a talk and he agreed to go to rehab i took him to rehab but at that point he wa in such bad shape he ended up in the icu his liver had shut down and multiple doctor were telling me that we may be looking at a transplant in his future his recovery ha been long and hard he lost his job after he came back from medical leave and it s been a struggle to get him to work on himself he went to a few aa meeting and therapy session and i got him to go to couple s therapy with me for a while until our therapist retired but since he got another job he s been working a ton and he completely stopped going to any of that i m also pretty sure he doesn t think of himself a an alcoholic just a someone who got into a bad place but is past it now i ve tried to push him gently towards these thing but i admittedly really struggle with communicating and he s so good at passive resistance that i ve just become exhausted a few week ago he had an mri to see if he had any long term damage to his liver and found out that physically he ha recovered 100 it s really unbelievable and he is just so incredibly lucky to not only have survived but to have no long term physical damage he s said himself he know how lucky he is he wa literally on life support 8 month ago and now he s lost 80 pound ha a new and better job and really doe have a lot of potential i have told him multiple time that if he drink again then i m leaving he s brought it up again because he doesn t think he s an alcoholic so he would say thing like how he want to just have some wine or whatever and so i wa crystal clear with him that i would not go through this nightmare again it wa unsurprisingly incredibly traumatizing for me and we are dealing with a lot of medical bill a a result that s not something i m going to do twice one of my friend got married this weekend and it wa a big reunion with people i haven t seen in a long time we talked about it beforehand and i told him that i wanted to drink some but we are all in our 30 so it wasn t going to be anything crazy and there were also several of my other friend who weren t drinking for various reason so while there wa alcohol around it wasn t this high pressure environment full of peer pressure or people doing shot he said it wa fine but i wa still nervous because i knew he probably felt that because of his mri result he d be ok to drink again i wa honestly tense for most of the wedding at dinner he took a tiny sip of wine and i just stared at him but wasn t going to make a scene other than that he wa drinking mocktails a far a i know we got back to the hotel and i went to bed because i wa exhausted but he went downstairs to hang out with some people who were still up he wa only gone for maybe 30 minute today one of my friend who wa downstairs told me she had something to tell me and i knew exactly what she wa going to say she came downstairs and saw him with a beer he put it down when he saw her and today when i d asked him how his night wa he mentioned other people had beer but definitely made an effort to make it sound like it wa other people drinking not him he s flying home today while i m staying out here for work i won t see him for a few more day and i know we need to talk but before we do i really just wanted to get some objective advice from people who don t know either of u because honestly i just feel overwhelmed and so so tired i m not going to automatically move out or anything over one beer but we are going to have a conversation where he need to decide if he s choosing me or he s choosing drinking that s logical right

i let him cheat on me because he said he couldn t live without them we were in a relationship for 2 year and he had me so convinced that he couldn t live with only me a a partner so he had another partner online i didn t mind her she wa a good friend of mine and their relationship seemed more like a mislabeled friendship than anything else then he without my consent sent graphic message and who know what else to someone i had never even heard of before when i confronted him about it he told me this whole story about how he believed this new person wa someone who he had been romantically involved with in a past life and that he actually could not live without him well i wa weak and easily guilt tripped since he had been actively suicidal and had been hospitalized before so i gave in immediately and hoped i would just be okay with it well two week later my ex boyfriend ha been totally mia from the relationship i haven t heard from him for day at a time when he wa supposed to check in with me daily a part of his safety routine from his therapist i find out that he s been sexting with this guy recieving nude and they ve been making plan for this new person to fly to our state and meet in person in order to hide this from me my ex boyfriend got a long distance relationship app and password protected it so i couldn t get into it when we were together in person this absolutely killed me i had a complete mental breakdown i swore at him over the phone i screamed i even climbed on the roof and considered jumping to my death because i felt so betrayed in the end i calmed myself crawled back in through my window and asked them to break up my ex boyfriend s response to this wa to say that if i made them break up he would kill himself i believed him too at that point breaking up with him felt completely out of the question because i seriously believed that i owed him everything and had to protect him from his childhood trauma and he only ever reinforced this by saying that he would die if i left him so we go back and forth for a month where i am begging him to stop messaging this guy and he threatens to hurt himself say i m controlling and abusive or just mock me in some way like saying he think it s funny to make me relapse and cut myself i can t believe that i let this go on for nearly six month i thought that after a month and a half of begging them to break up they had actually done it nope i found out right before we broke up that they had secretly kept in touch the entire time in the end i wa blamed for everything and i lost two very dear friend because of this guy i took the fall because i wa too controlling i wa manipulative and i made him feel like he had to be with me or he wasn t good enough i actually believed all of that for quite a while and since i had known him and been his friend for nearly 7 year i legitimately felt responsible for everything that went wrong 8 month later though i m doing great i have a new boyfriend who legitimately love me and want to look out for me he make me smile every day and he never force me to fix his problem for him he only ever asks me to help him figure out what to do i do still find myself believing lie my ex told me and thinking i m not enough but because of my current boyfriend i ve been relapse free for 6 month now,1
i 40m have been a widower for two year and am getting interest from a friend of mine 34f who ha rejuvenated my life quite a bit should i start dating again even if i m still grieving for my wife and daughter i met jessica back in march through mutual friend we play on the same team on pub quiz once a week from the onset jessica and i have really bonded over a lot of mutual interest she is a bigger sport nut and beer connoisseur than me which is saying something i have hung out with her quite frequently with our mutual friend and i ve also become friend with her sister who i ve also gotten along with pretty well a i ve gotten to know jessica and vice versa i ve told her my history my wife of 12 year together for 18 and young daughter were killed in an auto accident over 2 year ago i still think about it everyday and while it ha been getting better i still have bad day birthday anniversary day of the accident holiday and am definitely still grieving i also have a 10 year old son that i m parenting myself which a you can imagine keep me busy i wa pretty much depressed and threw myself into my work and my son but lacked the passion for anything until i met jessica not only do we have many thing in common we ve had many conversation about life in general i m definitely attracted to her but at the same time i wasn t sure i wa in a good enough place mentally to start dating jessica ha been recently sorting through some grief of her own her father passed away tragically about a month ago i had taken the day off at work to attend the memorial service and she seems genuinely touched when i showed up i had been mulling over asking jessica out for a while but put it on the backburner when her father died a few day ago she surprised me with a text asking if i m free on friday tonight to attend an nba game with her the other ticket wa for her sister who can t make it basketball is my favorite sport but i don t see it live very often my son is all about the nhl and my son wa having a sleepover at his cousin s so i agree to go of course i m wondering is this a date this will be the first time jessica and i will be hanging out alone i asked a mutual friend if he knew anything about this invitation and he simply said it s exactly what you think it is is it right to go on this date and perhaps develop more of a relationship with jessica while i m still not completely over the death of my wife and daughter i also haven t had a first date in about 20 year so even though i already know jessica well and like her a great deal i m also somewhat nervous tl dr friend of mine essentially asked me on a date to an nba game i really like spending time with her but still grieving for my wife s and daughter s death 2 year ago am i in a good enough mental state to possibly start a relationship again,0

my 25f husband s 25m grandmother 79f doesn t believe in invisible illness or disability and my husband won t stand up for me so to start i have 2 really impactful chronic health condition i have a genetic disorder heds which make my joint unstable so i am easily injured and have had a few injury that have led to permanent damage that no surgery or physical therapy will fix i wa diagnosed 2 year ago given the nature of heds though i ve had it my entire life and have had issue with it since childhood and will continue to be impacted all my life the second condition is ulcerative colitis which is autoimmune i have been in a flare since january and wa officially diagnosed in august it ha already been staged a severe and if my current medication doesn t achieve remission i ll be put on a biologic in january 2020 it s also caused anemia due to the long and severe flare my husband and i have been together for 10 year married for 2 his family overall like me and the only issue with them in general wa that we didn t have a traditional formal wedding his parent quickly moved on from caring about that but his grandmother hasn t and ha decided that anything she doesn t agree with or particularly like that my husband doe is somehow my fault on top of that she refuse to believe that my health condition are valid and feel strongly that i need to pull myself up by my bootstrap join the military and possibly see combat and that ll straighten me out never mind that i wouldn t be able to join due to my health and no recruiter would want me to she s said that in general she doesn t believe young people can be sick or disabled and that those without an obvious mental impairment or not confined to a wheelchair are absolutely not disabled and would benefit from military service she also belief that for someone to be disabled they must have had that disability since birth and with the severity staying consistent people don t just suddenly get sick and if they actually are disabled they don t just suddenly get worse i know that the likelyhood of her changing her mind is incredibly low the thing that bother me most is that my husband never defends me he say to me when i ask him that he like to remain neutral when talking to his grandmother about me what he considers neutral is very clearly not actually neutral nor is it at all helpful or supportive of me for instance he wa on the phone with his grandmother on saturday discussing christmas plan and i overheard him respond to her asking about me with oh you know the usual pause yes she still think that he said it all in that tone of voice people will use when they re discussing the action of a person they don t agree with when they got off the phone i asked him about it and he confirmed that yes they were discussing how i wa still sick or at least a his grandmother feel that i still think i m sick he then once again reminded me that he wa handling it by being neutral because he s not feeding into it by directly bashing me but passively agreeing because it too much effort and serf no purpose to defend me when it won t change her mind about disabled people in general or necessarily how she ll view me he told me that i need to get over this and it seems like i have a mental health problem if something like this really bother me i really don t think i m being too sensitive i haven t been allowed to accompany him on visit to his grandparent house in the past 2 year he always take my car leaving me without a vehicle because i can t drive his company vehicle and ha in the past gone for lunch said he d be home for dinner and then didn t get back til around 8 pm and didn t text me to let me know he wa eating with them because his grandmother find people using their phone in her presence rude and disrespectful honestly i feel like i m being majorly disrespected in that he never defends me and bend over backwards for his grandmother to prevent her from throwing a fit now the current issue is that we re both expected to go to her house for christmas where we ll both be expected to spend the majority of the day he won t stand up for me and doesn t want me to make a scene or stir the pot by standing up for myself which mean that i m supposed to just passively take a day s worth of passive aggressive comment and act polite apologetic passive and give vague answer without bringing my health up when asked about me i really don t want to follow that plan all of the rest of his family is kind and supportive of me his mother ha even said she view me like one of her own kid other people there are more likely to defend me especially my mother in law i just don t know what to do if he keep passively staying his version of neutral it could even negatively impact my health certain medication i may need including my current one can suppress my immune system and since she doesn t believe in autoimmune disease she may lie about sick relative or he may even avoid asking so a not to bring up my health i know my mother in law will likely have my back and keep sick people away from me but i m concerned that my husband doesn t take me seriously and will let something happen in an effort to keep the peace honestly to at least some degree i feel my husband doesn t care about my health condition or even agrees with his grandmother after all he s never read up on the 2 condition i live with even when i provided him with resource including print out and brochure from my doctor so it s not like i told him to google a certain website and he just forgot he s said that whatever the paper say i can just tell him but to stick to what s currently relevant to my case i know that he know and belief i do have these condition but i feel he downplays them he doe show worry and concern and help me and take care of me at home but often can t handle serious conversation or anything emotional how do i handle this do i stand up for myself do i provide medical proof how can i better get through to my husband that this isn t just me being sensitive how do i explain how exhausting it is to take on the full emotional burden of explaining and defending my health repeatedly to various people or having to just act normal a well a the physical toll it take on me i feel like i ve already tried everything i ve been patient i ve been empathetic i know how to communicate effectively but i just can t get through to him that it s his responsibility to defend me to his family he s supposed to advocate for me too i can t just do it all i m not staying home i don t want to have to exile myself from people i enjoy the company of just because of this one person and i don t think it would be fair to just let him take my car so he can go by himself and leave me home alone all day on christmas i have my own family but without my car i wouldn t be able to see them either plus i don t know if this make sense but i can t stand the thought of him taking my car and leaving me alone so that he can spend time with someone i know insult me even more when i m not around in a sense it feel like i m being taken advantage of and being treated like an unimportant object tl dr i have health condition that my grandmother in law doesn t believe in and my husband allows her to insult me to my face and behind my back i m expected to spend christmas with her be polite and not bring up the controversial topic of my health while evading her intrusive question the rest of my in law are pretty good but i still don t want to put up with insult from my husband s grandmother or him not defending me how can i get him to work with me instead of against me on this,0

gf 24f is super upset about engagement ring i 26m haven t bought yet we ve been together for about 2 5 year with about a 3 4 month break in the middle there we ve also been living together for about a month or so we ve known the plan is to get married and we ve set a tentative date to get engaged towards the end of this year or so nothing set in stone when we previously talked about engagement ring she just wanted something kind of simplistic that would cost between 1 5 2 5k and i thought that wa pretty fair i had her send me some photo of the ring she wanted and i had been looking around and had found a couple of the same style she wanted and had an idea in my head of how much to spend cut to today she went to the diamond store with her mom while her mom got one of her ring fixed she came home and told me she looked at ring and changed her mind about what she wanted she showed me a photo and while it wa pretty it wa also huge she told me the ring she want now will cost about 5k and i told her i wouldn t spend that on a ring because that s a bit ridiculous she told me to just take out a loan and pay it off later but i don t necessarily think it s a great financial choice to go 5k into debt to marry the woman who want to marry me we had previously agreed on a price point but she got pissed and stormed off when i told her that i think 5k is too much to spend on a ring we re not currently talking right now and she s on the phone with her mom right now i don t want her to think i m cheap but i like to think i m pretty good with money and going into that much debt over the ring just seems kind of unnecessary to me any guidance you all can offer would be great tl dr we got in a huge fight over a disagreement on engagement ring price at a bit of a loss,0
i 22m have started to notice some sexist tendency in my attitude toward my partner 19f how can i start to re wire my thinking first time poster i ve recently come out of a 5 year relationship and began dating my current girlfriend just over two month ago in that time i ve recognized a general pattern of patronizing behavior on my part which i feel ha harmed our ability to develop our relationship further while with my friend i feel embarrassed by her style of humor her pop culture reference amp recommendation etc and try to police what she say even though my friend have never criticized her and in fact called me out recently for berating her while helping her with her university work meanwhile i have a tendency to jump immediately into correction mode criticizing and line editing little detail until they re no longer in her voice before realizing that in fact she s better educated than i am on the topic and doe actually know what she s doing shocking right my hope is that someone else who ha seen this in themselves or their partner can provide insight into how they ve broken these subconscious habit i have spoken with her about my thought and am aware of the specific action i ve done which bother her but for the purpose of this question i m more worried about the underlying attitude that informs those action and i would appreciate any practical feedback from those with experience tl dr my reflex with my partner ha been to patronize assume ignorance or naivety and sequester her from the other sphere of my life even though at the same time i very much want her to be involved i feel a though the connection we could be having is being undercut by this rooted assumption of mine that she is in a word immature i would appreciate any feedback from people familiar with this sort of attitude toward their partner,0

we are the punching bag for the narcissist ,1
my parent m f 58 are forcing my brother m 29 to live in their unheated garage and i m worried about him for context i live in one of the colder part of canada and it s regularly 20c 4f my brother let s call him tony ha been living in my parent unheated garage since september prior to that he wa sleeping in his car on the street in front of their house prior to that he wa living in a shed in my parent back yard on mat from his car and some blanket my dad gave him my mom refuse to let tony live in her house and instead of getting him the help and support he need my dad s workaround is to basically have my brother squatting in storage space in their suburban home tony ha struggled with a cocaine addiction since he wa 12 and dropped out of grade 9 so he s never done anything other than work construction job we come from a family where both of our parent are narcissist and where tony wa largely ignored for most of his life i wa the scapegoat and our younger brother is the golden child so it make sense that he developed an addiction a a result of using drug to cope with those feeling but after i cut tie with my parent thing got really bad for him because their negative attention turned to him in my absence a a result tony s life ha been a roller coaster of trying to get and keep his life together and then having it derailed by something my parent decided for example he found a new construction job but my dad wouldn t let him borrow the car to go to work and refused to get up in the morning to drive him so he could keep his job my parent are both semi retired every time i talk to tony he fixates on the idea of getting back into the house a his only method of solving his problem i ll suggest that he see someone about getting into low income housing or finding a men s shelter where he can find actual support and he ignores me because he s so convinced that the only way to solve his problem is to get back into the house a far a i can tell my parent aren t interested in helping him find access and stay engaged with any support system who could help him start building confidence and a sense of purpose allowing tony to live in the garage is apparently the most they re willing to do i can t get involved in this situation more than i already have i ve spent the better part of a decade in therapy due to the abuse i suffered growing up and am happy and healthy primarily because i ve kept my parent and their toxicity a far away from me a possible tony also can t stay with me he steal to feed his addiction and my partner and i have musical equipment computer etc in our home worth ten of thousand of dollar so that s not an option i ve called around to local shelter men s organization etc and they ve all told me that since tony is an adult he ha to be the one to reach out i can t even find someone to give him a call to see if he s ok it feel like the only other option is to call the police non emergency line pretend to be one of my parent neighbour and see if i can get the police to make a call to my parent house but that feel like a slippery slope to being dragged further into this mess than i already am it make me sick to think that my brother is waking up on the floor in my parent cold garage every morning but i feel powerless to help any advice support insight anyone can offer would be much appreciated tl dr my parent solution to my brother s addiction homelessness is to force him to live in their unheated garage it s winter and it s freezing here and i m worried about him and don t know what else to do,0

how do i stop being an abusive husband i don t want to give my whole life story to explain why i am the way i am perhaps in another post most of it wa learned from my father i suppose i imitate the relationship dynamic i witnessed a a child it wa normalized for me he is a browbeater and is super controlling about everything furthermore i have anger issue and generally feel like i have no control in my life and i put these frustration on the people around me i am like my father in many way and my marriage is on the rock we have a kid together and i suspect we ll end up separated eventually but i would like to learn how to stop the cycle stop the abuse and create a nurturing environment for my wife and child if it isn t already too late how would one go about doing this how can i treat people with respect when i don t treat myself with respect how can i be nice to others when i constantly trash talk myself i have a therapist i ve seen plenty of therapist but nothing substantial ever come out of it any advice,1
my 28f boyfriend 30m of 7 year ha crossed over into obese territory i m no longer attracted to him and i m not sure what to do i ll just cut to the chase over the last couple of year my boyfriend ha put on a significant amount of weight and my attraction to him ha nosedived when i met him he wa around 180 lb but now he s around 230 lb maybe more i believe the weight gain is directly related to issue that impact him and our relationship i ve stayed the same size the entire duration of our relationship 130lbs so it s not like we re in this together i have a big sweet tooth but balance that out by exercising and walking biking a my main mode of transportation around our city a you ve probably guessed sex is becoming difficult if he even muster up the energy to participate his stamen is shot and some of the thing i used to like doing are off the table he ha begun snoring really bad to the point where it s not only effecting his sleep but my own he complains of sore joint and just generally feeling exhausted all the time he work an extremely physical job and long hour so i can sympthasize that after 10 hour of working and a 1hr commute home you don t want to head to the gym but he s in a state now where i don t think calorie counting is going to be enough plus i m not confident he won t cheat or stick to a regime i can tell he is extremely sensitive about this he talk about how big he ha become and how much he hate his body soemtimes i feel so sad for him and i really don t know what to say and then other time i m so frustrated with his lack of motivation i just want to say yup you ve gained a ton of weight and clearly you don t care that much because it continues to get worse you can probably tell i am growing resentful i m starting to think the only way he will start caring about himself again is if i leave i ve tried inviting him to join me at the gym come to yoga bike riding i am very seldom taken up on the offer and there s always some excuse i watch him eat dinner and then sometimes snack until he go to bed we can t have any sort of treat in the house because it s gone instantly to be blunt it s beginning to piss me off the lack of self control is probably the most unattractive part in all of this not to make it all about me but having a partner that doesn t care about themselves is harming my self esteem too it s hurtful to think i m with someone that doesn t care if i m attracted to them or not that i ll be around regarldess so why would they need to try i am seriously considering giving an ultimatum here get a plan together or i m leaving i know that sound extreme but i don t think i deserve to be in a sexless lazy relationship because he doesn t want to invest in himself i don t know what else to do at this point is that a bad idea i m over being gentle about this but i m not sure how to muster the courage to be direct i am afraid it will backfire and he will feel defeated and slip further into these habit on the other hand should i even bother or just be done with this tl dr my boyfriend ha put on some significant weight and combined with the self deprecation and lack of motivation i am unattracted to him right now should i find a gentle way of telling him how serious this is or just be blunt or just throw in the towel altogether,0
i 29 f have to tell my friend 30 f that i do not feel safe letting her son 7 m who ha autism hold my baby 14 mo f this feel really awful to type out but i don t know how to go about having this conversation without hurting people i deeply care about and i need some advice from others not involved so here go my friend from college becca had her son peter when she wa 23 about a year after we graduated she had a very difficult pregnancy and our group of friend tried to be a supportive a possible during and after the baby wa born peter wa a really difficult baby and becca had pretty severe ppd a he grew up he wasn t meeting many of the developmental milestone that he should have been and wa eventually diagnosed with autism to be blunt becca ha had an incredibly difficult time in life since he wa born and the moment of joy have been few and far between peter can be a sweet loving boy but a a result of his profound developmental disability he ha many behavior that are insanely hard to handle both becca and her husband have gone to great length and have tried every possible form of therapy med supplement etc that they can find they re both very savvy regarding resource group thing like that but life ha not been easy for any of them our friend group ha tried to babysit a frequently a possible to give them a break over the year fast forward to the present peter is now 7 he is nonverbal partially blind and deaf and ha several chronic medical issue he ha frequent outburst and is mostly self destructive he bite himself hit his head against the wall or floor and rip apart his surroundings this seems to be almost daily sometimes if not multiple time a day i truly believe they are trying everything to help peter live the best life possible he is heavily monitored medically speaking and participates in a many activity a he can i have always felt that they are both excellent parent but over the year our crew of girlfriend ha kind of dwindled in term of helping becca with peter she ha been a stay at home mom for his entire life and her husband work a lot to pay for their life and all of peter s support i don t necessarily blame my friend for being le down to babysit peter a he grew older and became much more difficult to handle one of our close friend andrea wa watching peter regularly but stopped when he wa 5 after he bit her badly enough to require stitch nobody blamed her for this decision she ended up with nerve damage and she also did not feel like she could keep peter safe his behavior wa beyond her ability to provide childcare myself and one of our other friend have still been babysitting peter about once every month and a half we go together peter will already have his safety gear on basically a helmet and protective mitten and becca and her husband don t stay away too long they also have a paid support team to watch him but this is something we do to just demonstrate support for our good friend and because we do love peter we spend time with all of them together but feel like they should have a free hour to get coffee and stroll through target every once and a while i know that i have basically painted him a a violent menace to society but that s not the case the majority of his outburst aren t prolonged rip the house to shred kind of ordeal he mostly focus on himself so the aim of the game is to keep him from hurting himself a much a possible that being said peter love baby he s fascinated by them and is so gentle with them i ve seen him hold his baby cousin on multiple occasion when he wa a little bit younger but a far a i m aware he hasn t really been trusted since he s gotten older and his outburst have grown with him this make becca sad a peter s favorite toy are baby doll and he love holding them he is always gentle with his baby doll toy and they seem to be one of the only thing he doesn t destroy in an outburst he ha never hurt a baby in any way okay now here is the part i have been dreading typing after all of that despite peter s love of baby and his history of being a very responsible baby holder i do not trust him to hold my daughter she is a little over a year old now and peter ha never met her i don t live super close to them and when i go to babysit it wouldn t make sense for me to bring her a peter requires our full attention and an infant is like the worst possible companion in that situation however becca ha recently asked me if i would be willing to let peter meet my daughter and possibly hold her my response to her wa a kind of half answer i didn t really say yes or no just that we d have to see if that would work out she seemed to take that a a yes and is now trying to actively make plan for our kid to meet so when she first suggested this my immediate gut feeling wa fuck no i love peter i want him to be happy but my baby s safety is my absolute top priority right now it is factual to say that peter s outburst are unpredictable and just because he wa gentle with baby in the past and is gentle with baby doll now doe not mean that i feel safe with him holding my child he ha been violent with other kid and adult on several occasion and ultimately after talking about it my husband agrees with me i know i should have just been direct with becca in the first place but i kind of panicked i really don t want to hurt her she is a wonderful person and a great friend and ha been through a lot i don t think that she s in a very good place right now and i worry that telling her peter cannot hold my baby or meet her because he will want to hold her if he doe and an outburst will ensue if he can t will be devastating to her i know she feel like she doesn t have the ability to give her child any happiness and she s been talking about him meeting a baby for a while without directly asking me if that baby can be my daughter i feel really awful typing this out i don t want to seem offensive i just want to support my friend and her child but i need to keep my child safe tldr friend s son who ha autism ha frequent violent outburst but love baby and would love to hold one i do not feel safe giving him my 1 year old to hold a his behavior is unpredictable my friend ha asked me if he can meet my baby and i do not know how to tell her no without crushing her,0
my friend 30sf is convinced that i 30sf am having a mental breakdown based upon how i decorate my house i think she s rude she think i m insane we aren t speaking tldr my friend and i both 30sf are having a long standing conflict a she think i m having a mental crisis breakdown based upon the insane furniture decor selection in my house i think she s being crazy and extremely rude and have told her such she think i am having a mental breakdown and we are now not speaking basic background i am a married woman in my mid 30 s my friend is also married in her mid 30 s we both work highly professional job and are considered high achiever performer in our field we are both childfree by choice i m fairly close with this person 5 year friendship at this point and consider her one of my closest friend however her behavior lately is seriously putting thing at risk a i don t know how much more of the snide outright hostile comment i can take the situation lately my husband and i married 10 year have decided we want to make our house more homey comfy per our standard so we have been getting item for our home that make u feel joy laugh etc i want to be clear that my home is not cluttered or overfilled with stuff a i know that can bring some people very understandable anxiety quite the opposite my home is very clean and we have a small but apparently weirdly curated selection of thing my friend ha some seriously intense feeling about this here are some of the weird or bizarre according to her standard thing we have put in our house a dark purple fluffy couch chaise lounge thing this thing is so soft that i can t even describe it like lying in a big bowl of fuzzy bliss however yes the thing is pretty ugly by most standard and doesn t really go with the other decor if you can even call it that in my home i give no crap about this it make both my partner and i happy is extremely comfortable and looking at it honestly just make me smile a rug that ha dinosaur wearing cape and space helmet the color go fabulously with my stuff it isn t in cartoony child room style and it actually fairly pretty and decently artistic but yeah it dinosaur in space helmet and cape again the rug totally cheer me up i have some dnd miniature we painted that i have put on my mantle we put them in an order where it look like some comical fight ha gone down again crack me up my husband and i often move them around in silly way to make it look more ridiculous it a fun game at this point to wait for the other person to notice and then narrate what they think happened i painted some glow and the dark constellation on our bedroom ceiling this took me forever and i put a ton of planning into it i used to live in the middle of the countryside and had some amazing star view and now live in a city and have none the glowing star look great and cheer me up when i go to sleep i have some science beaker in my kitchen that i use for measuring during cooking my husband and i are both big science nerd so again it just go with u also they are extremely practical and the best thing i have ever used for cooking cocktail making i painted a tiny wall upstairs it this awkward 4 sq foot area that kind of hang solo with a spray on chalk like paint i write weird poem to my husband on it the poem usually involve our cat our dog strange dream chore he ha forgotten or lamenting having to work what seems to have really put her over the edge this latest time is that i hung some goofy looking lantern in a few place throughout my house it wa actually her idea to put some light there a i wa talking about my room being a bit dark but apparently she didn t expect me to put up some star like lantern that put big pattern on your wall i also got an essential oil diffuser at the same time i like the smell and she seemed appalled that i got a weird one again it a constellation type ball that give off a cool light her comment first started a kind of subtle jab such a did you know it would be that color when you ordered it i bet you were so disappointed that it so purple did one of your coworkers kid get that for you hmm it well noticeable you are leaning heavy into the eclectic these day it look like a playroom in here they have now devolved into straight up insult interrogation though she ha now sat me down on 2 occasion to discus this rapid shifting she asked if i m having a mental crisis nope told me i m just trying too hard to be original unique i m not i just like the thing and even went so far a to ask if this wa some sort of psychotic manifestation of me secretly and desperately wanting a child wtf she told me that no sane person in their 30 s would have this in their home and that people are going to think we are insane weird i told her several different time that i thought she wa being rude that i don t appreciate her comment etc i have been very direct about this i have now sat her down formally and told her that i think she is offensive and insulting that it isn t her house and that she can either keep her opinion to herself or she isn t welcome in my home anymore which ha now turned into u not speaking for two week until yesterday when she sent me this i am sorry that thing have been so strained between u i am concerned for your well being and i am trying to be a good friend by telling you the thing that other people would be too polite to say if you cannot appreciate that then i guess our friendship isn t a valuable a i thought seriously how am i even supposed to respond to that total non apology am i crazy doe she have a point my house is clean in good shape but yes i put non traditional thing in it she asked me at one point if i thought my house wa aesthetically pleasing my response wa basically no but i don t care about that it brings me joy and make me laugh she stated that because i admitted it wa ugly not what i said i just acknowledged that it not aesthetically pleasing that i must realize there is a problem is it really that unusual for people my age to have such thing in their house for side info all of my other friend have seemed to really really love the change some of them actually seem jealous that we have so many fun comfy thing in our house that we both agree on and enjoy all concur that my fuzzy purple beast of a chaise is indeed hideous but that it it also the most comfortable thing they have ever laid on we are a nerdy group that spends time playing board game doing art together and playing dnd so we aren t even what one would consider a traditional group so what give,0

i wa 13 and he wa 19 year old i m 23 now and this happened year ago and even though the relationship could ve been worse i m still afraid of him after all this time i just turned 13 and just got my first small shitty little laptop at the time i wanted to post art on youtube and deviantart because i wa apart of the sonic fandom yes i know i wa a lonely weird kid so i posted a few edgy music video with my oc s and met a few good friend that were around the same age a me note this is the time when youtube had group and chatroom it would be a few month later i met a guy who claimed to be 18 at the time we talked for a bit then he started flirting with me being bullied a lot a a kid i wa pretty much easily influenced into talking with anyone that gave me any compliment well at first it wasn t too bad he seemed friendly a bit childish for his age but nonetheless he seemed like a good guy that wa until my current bf at the time he wa 14 and him where talking and he convinced u to sext for him while he watched the text i didn t understand what sex wa at the time living in a bible belt town no one talked about that stuff all i knew wa if you had sex you were a bad person despite feeling like i wa going to get in trouble we ended up doing it because he started to make u feel bad by using the i m sad approach so we did and for some reason dumb fucking 13 year old me still talked to this freak because he made me feel nice most of it though had died down that wa until i broke up with my then boyfriend and he immediately used that a a opportunity to take me under his wing it then turned from chatting normally to suddenly full on sexual it wa mostly text about what he wanted to do with me and how he wanted to get me pregnant although that got even worse when we started talking on skype together he began having me stay up late at night to talk to him about something this is when the anger issue started popping up once he had seen my face he would call me horrible stupid bitch every time i wouldn t stay up with him and wa tired he would lie to me about thing like he made up a story about how his ex girlfriend had died while she wa pregnant with his baby sent picture of the girl and everything and then when the same girl found out about what he wa doing and called him out so i brought it up to him he basically went off about how i don t know what i m talking about i m too stupid and young to understand that someone actually hacked him that i wa a lair and because i apparently hated him so much he wa going to commit suicide he did this by the way whenever he wanted just to make me upset and cry not showing him enough of my 13 year old vagina suicide threat didn t want to stay up til 4am in the morning when i had school the next day suicide threat my fucking grandpa in the hospital that had cancer who wa dying and i don t want to strip for him well i guess your going to loose both of u actual fucking word he said basically i gave him what he wanted 24 7 or i m a horrible person for not catering to him it s not a bad a when i wa video chatting with him though he would randomly just whip out his dick and expose himself to me even when i would say i m sorry i don t want to see he would tell me how stupid i wa for not understanding certain sexual act i m fucking 13 how the hell am i suppose to know he would encourage me to continue cutting myself a it wa a better way instead of actually committing suicide despite the numerous time he would threaten it on me he would see my body and go you know you ve got a good face if only you had the body of insert ex here then everything would be perfect i mean your hot but your still fat you don t seem that developed in some place when my grandpa died and i wa mourning he tried to call me but i wa basically bawling at the fact i just lost someone very dear to me his response well your no fun right now i guess i ll talk to you later he would also later cheat on me by trying to get with my get this other 13 year old cousin he even convinced her later to have her tell me i wasn t good enough for him but she wa he continued this on with her until my cousin said this wa too weird and let it go i still can t talk to her to this day because that just ya know hurt during the time i couldn t talk like during my grandpa s funeral or at time when i wa at the hospital with him he would tell me how much he banged other girl and when i told him it hurt he basically responded no no they re nothing like you i m just fucking them to prepare myself for you the final straw wa he found where i wa going to highschool he said he wa going to come and find me and have sex with me he had just turned 19 i wa absolutely terrified what snapped me out of it wa when i went to my mom and told her the whole situation she supported me and told me what to do end it and if he ever come over to let someone know and my parent would handle the son of a bitch strangely though a part of me wanted to see if they were a good side to him stupid i know i told him i wasn t ready for sex he flipped out and told me i m not good enough for him at that point i send a goodbye note and blocked him and moved account that night he tried following me to find me and tried to message me he filled a bunch of my old channel with threat and shit like that but luckily he never found me in my high school or anything like that i knew if i went through with meeting him it would have ended up horribly i still feel weak though because after that i felt nothing but distrust towards people i hated myself and the fear that i may have caused someone to hurt themselves side note he found my new account and followed me a few week ago no message so far or the lasting thought he put into my head about any relationship ever since him my relationship have mostly failed because i honestly can t trust anyone to be in a relationship with i know this isn t nearly a bad a thing could ve been face to face i feel so fucking weak about this and how stupid i feel knowing i could ve just clicked away and never heard from that sicko ever again but i didn t i wa young stupid etc etc i got to thinking about it and i honestly don t know why this is still affecting me to this day,1

do i warn my friend 35f that her husband is thinking about calling it quits 35f and i m kind of friend with this woman i try to keep my distance on and off because she s a chronic complainer and constantly negative she s married to a great guy and i ve started dating his good friend who is incredible so we ve all been spending a lot of time together it s been painfully obvious that her husband is unhappy and is hitting his breaking point he is talking about it more openly with my bf and even asks me for advice i ve tried to give his wife some hint when we are alone together but none are taken she ha refused to be intimate with him for a long time which is her right don t get me wrong but even when we are double dating she spends all of her time on her phone making snide remark and dig to her husband and if she doe join the conversation she start complaining about some drama in her life i consider her husband a good person and a friend and he s being hurt feel taken advantage of and is asking for help she blame her inability to be happy or close to her husband on health problem but unfortunately i know that her health issue are highly fabricated and her addiction to pain pill is high and i ve seen her straight faced lie to multiple people about it she doesn t want to work and i ve also been aware of small white lie manipulation to her husband a well such a her planning to set him up to use her car when it s on empty so he will fill it with gas or keeping money she doe get hidden from him so i hear her nonchalantly almost in a cocky way tell me these little thing that she plan out and then if he mention anything she cry or flip out and give him the angry silent treatment for day so his 2 big stressor are the intimacy and finance and she shuts him down every time he brings either up her facebook feed is full of complete lie from big to small fabricated happiness but yet i feel like i m watching a building burn down in flame and about to explode and i feel like i should warn her and ask her to think about all she is about to lose she doe not take criticism well i tried once and got blasted and if she s complaining in a group setting and receives advice she completely ignores it and keep bitching i honestly feel like she set up every day and every stressor in her daily life in order to create tension and anger between them in order to not have to confront her own problem or be close to him in any way it seems to be so planned out that on a certain day of the week i know exactly what she s going to be freaking out about that day do i watch the building burn down to the ground or do i try to say something to her even though i m 99 sure she will completely turn on me with spite and anger gossiping behind my back a she doe about all of her other friend i feel like i just want her completely out of my life and not to mess with it i ve been seeing my new bf a lot more on my own now so perhaps i can slowly back away from her that may be the answer but i just want to know if i should at least try to warn her in case she is just truly oblivious tldr this girl friend is a train wreck do i warn her that her marriage is about to crash and burn even if just for her kid sake or do i distance myself from the negativity before it get worse,0
i 25f had a friend 25m over last night to catch up and it upset my boyfriend 26m my bf and i have been together for a year i ran into a guy friend yesterday who i hadn t seen in a while we aren t super close these day but he s the kind of friend that i could not talk to for month but when we get together it s like no time ha passed i ve known him for about three year anyways we were both free last night so we made plan to grab a drink together it wa raining and we re both kind of broke right now so i invited him over to my place instead of going out i called my boyfriend before my friend came over we had a normal conversation about our day etc and i let him know that i had plan to see my friend i told him it wa a guy friend he wa totally fine with this my friend came over around 8 and we had a nice time catching up around 10 30 my boyfriend texted me and i let him know that my friend wa still over my bf asked if i could call him and he wa clearly upset on the phone not mad he just sounded flustered he asked if he could come over and i said sure he came and met my friend and the three of u hung out for maybe 15 minute before my friend left my bf said he thought it wa weird that i wa hanging out with a guy he had never heard of alone in my apartment so late he said he trust me but felt really jealous when he found out that my friend wa still over i think i probably have mentioned this friend to my bf before but like i said my friend and i aren t that close we aren t in the same friend group so to see each other we really go out of our way anyways in hindsight i can definitely see where my bf is coming from i would have been jealous too if the role were reversed but i also don t like the idea that i can t have certain friend over after a certain time of the day just because i m in a relationship my bf said he doesn t like having those rule either did i cross a line though wa what i did inappropriate this is the first more serious relationship i ve been in in a long time so sometimes i m not entirely sure what s ok and what s not tl dr i had a male friend over at my apartment into the evening and it made my boyfriend jealous,0
my 23f boyfriend 39m is pushing for an open relationship even though i made it clear i m against it how do i make him understand we ve been together for about an year now and most of it ha been smooth sailing he s sweet we don t argue a lot we have the same interest etc spending time with him is comforting to me he s a genuinely kind person so it s pretty surreal to me that this is happening this all started a little over a month ago when he told me he s interested in having an open relationship with me he said it so casually i thought i heard him wrong at first just to mention i m all for people who live the lifestyle they want to live but for me personally an open relationship is just a big huge effing no i m just not that kind of person so after i asked him where that came from and if he wa serious i just told him i m definitely not comfortable with the idea he just shrugged and that wa that or so i thought for the past month he kept bringing it up and i tried to calmly said no but today when he condescendingly told me i don t know why you re so against it isn t it trendy right now i kind of snapped and i told him that i wa not ok with him sleeping with other girl and that i wa hurt he would share me so easily he then kind of laughed and had the nerve to say that even if we were in an open relationship i probably won t sleep with guy because i m so loyal i grabbed my stuff and left we haven t spoken since then and he is blowing up my phone with message that are mostly him covering his as with i didn t mean it like that honestly is there any way to explain this to him properly so he understands i feel like our relationship is doomed if he doesn t drop it tl dr i told my boyfriend that i m not comfortable with an open relationship he keep pushing me and it resulted in a fight i don t know how to move past this without ending our relationship is there a way to make him understand,0

how can i f23 tell my bos m40 with whom i have an occasional relationship that i m pregnant posting again because my previous post wa removed i m new using reddit and i don t know how it work i m sorry we met three year ago when i f23 started working for him m40 at that time he wa divorcing his now ex wife of course from the beginning i thought he wa really handsome and i wa very attracted to him but i never tried anything because he only had eye for his wife even when she cheated on him with another man two year ago he finally divorced her and he wa devastated he ha a good relationship with his employee but he always had a different relationship with me he used to tell me about his wife and the thing she did he even cried once talking about her and the man she cheated on him with he never tried to flirt with me and always treated me like his friend but a few month ago our relationship changed drastically it wa my birthday and since my whole family is in my home country i wa going to spend that day alone so he and my coworkers prepared a surprise dinner for me it wa a very special night and at the end of the night he took me to my house and he kissed me since then we started flirting and we always kissed when we were alone and a few month ago we got sexually involved he wa the first and only man i had sex with and since then i ve fallen in love even more with him the problem is that he never asked me to have a formal relationship but he is really sweet last sunday while we were having lunch he hugged me and said i love you but i don t know if he meant it i didn t answer him and we didn t talk about it later but i don t know if i can stand this anymore because a few week ago i learned that i m 10 week pregnant i always dreamed of getting married having child and a loving husband and none of that is happening because i did everything wrong my parent will hate me and tell me we told you so and i m sure they will hate their grandchild too but i want to keep the baby i don t know what to do at this point i m not sure of anything should i tell him how can i tell him tl dr we met three year ago when i f23 started working for him m40 at that time he wa divorcing his now ex wife two year ago he finally divorced her and a few month ago our relationship changed drastically we got sexually involved and now i m 10 week pregnant but i don t know how can i tell him,0
update i left and you can do it too update i left and i just wanted to shout it from the mountaintops my first and only reddit post is here i need to leave my and i am just so thankful for the insight i gained there there wa some blunt reality but it felt loving and it s a big part of what made me realize i wa fooling myself in thinking my husband would change or that his habit and behavior wouldn t negatively effect our kid i wa encouraged to start seeing a therapist which i did the first one i tried ended up being a beautiful fit which i regard a nothing le than a miracle she wa blunt and insightful and gave me the courage i needed to face my guilt and fear and put my kid first he s an addict that is a lifelong battle and because of everything else he ha put me through and let me do alone i just do not have the love necessary to want to face that battle together with him forever it took me just under 3 month from feeling totally conflicted to conquering my doubt making a plan and getting the hell out making that plan wa seriously my biggest obstacle and i let it be i think i used it a a crutch finally i sat there for 2 hour and went through every possibility till it just clicked and i went duh that can totally work 5 day later i took all my stuff and the kid while he wa at work here is what i want to share with those who face similar situation my therapist let me know a kindly a she could that although i did a great job of protecting my kid there wa no way i could guarantee 100 that they would always be safe there and if they ever got into any of those drug or were harmed because of them my kid would also be taken away from me for staying in a home where i knew those danger were present for subjecting them to it that shattered my perception of control real fast because it true we cannot watch every movement every minute i just wanted to stand proudly and say that after 7 year of desperately clinging to any chance at happiness equality and a partnership i wa finally able to leave the man i have been in love with for 16 year i truly believed with every fiber of my soul he wa my one true love and i almost didn t make it through the first week away it wa much more difficult than i expected having grown to hate him so much it still hurt but i did make it through and already i am so much happier so much freer my kid are more loved he is finally giving them attention and i can see hope for u all i made excuse for his behavior because i felt i could see the nuance of it all but what others helped me realize is that some behavior need no nuance to it some stuff is just fucked up no matter how you slice it so i just wanted to encourage anyone else who is in a similar situation you might need to start talking more about your problem so that others can help you see how little control you have and how horrible it really is then put yourself first don t let them manipulate you back in and get the hell out if you know in your heart you should tl dr my husband is a lazy selfish drug addict who i could just never quite convince myself to leave but i finally shared my struggle with others who helped me see the real problem and accept the solution taking the kid and gtfo already we are so much better off,0

i 26f have a coworker friend 24f who think she s absolutely killing it at work despite several performance warning how do i warn her not to ask for a raise title pretty much say it all there s a bit of background for context so if you don t feel like reading and want to skip to the end i understand i ve known my friend for a couple of year now and we work together at the same company i think that she is a lovely person and enjoy our friendship outside of work during work though it is hard to describe her a a hard worker team player let s call my friend colleen we have similar role though i have been given more responsibility so my workload is naturally quite a bit heavier our work doesn t require a lot of social interaction and to be frank i often have to take a working lunch because i don t have time to step away i definitely do try to eat away from my desk when possible she take a long lunch pretty much every day and is extremely social she s a lot more relaxed despite having deadline to meet if she doesn t meet them it s not a big deal she s often away from her desk because she dislike her office mate and i personally don t like that other person either so i understand why she take time away it just doesn t look great she also come in late often and is easily overwhelmed when given extra responsibility my supervisor recently asked me to offset some responsibility onto my friend so that i may take a more active role in a huge year end project this is the second time they have discussed giving her some of my responsibility the first time she learned about having to take some of my task she asked that they increase her pay to be commensurate with her new role despite not knowing when exactly she would be getting these new responsibility basically asking for the raise without having done any of the new work yet the rub is that with her current workload she s doing about half what the rest of u are doing my supervisor told her outright that by giving her this additional amount of work that colleen would in fact be catching up to the rest of u in term of workload colleen responded by saying she doe an equal amount of work compared to the rest of u my supervisor asked her to pull a report to show her number were on par with mine and some of my other coworkers colleen pulled a report and the report still showed that she doe significantly le than u my bos responded to this report by saying she doe not do a much work a the rest of u and further that she is not a team player that she see her coming in late frequently and that she s not at her desk a much a she should be naturally this upset colleen but she feel my bos just ha an issue with her personally this supervisor is now leaving the company and we will be deferring to the person above her let s call her stephanie stephanie is aware of everyone s role in the department and ha an understanding of all the inter office dynamic stephanie ha echoed what my previous supervisor said that she doe not trust colleen on this huge year end project and that she would like to offset some of my responsibility to her after the new year i updated colleen to give her a head up about beginning training with me on some of the thing that i do and colleen informed me that she will once again be asking for a raise to reflect the new responsibility despite having been reprimanded so recently i truly think that this is not a good idea for colleen because i would literally bet money on the fact that my old supervisor and stephanie met to discus colleen s original ask for a raise and that they decided together she did not deserve one they are basically the two head of my department so anything that my old supervisor knew about her stephanie would also know about i think that we are all underpaid of course and everyone doe deserve an increase in pay but i think this would have a negative impact on colleen i truly do not understand why she will be asking for the same thing so shortly after being rejected for it despite not improving any of her behavior she also ha no idea that no one in upper management want her involved with the huge year end project how do i tell her tactfully that she s on thin ice at work and should not be asking for a raise amp x200b tl dr my friend is on thin ice at work and despite having been told that she think she s an absolute rock star she recently asked for a raise and my supervisor rejected it because she ha so many area that she need to improve on now my supervisor is leaving and she plan to ask for a raise again despite not improving anything how do i tell her that this is a terrible idea,0

after he left i fell suddenly ill which forced me to move back with my family hour away in my despair i asked bf s mom my only local connection to take care of something for me while i wa away but promised to make it up to her a soon a possible she agreed to help me but something felt off while away despite being in horrible pain i kept communicating with her offering many arrangement to unload the responsibility off her back she either rejected them or ignored me completely forcing herself to continue taking care of it all while being incredibly resentful and treating me a if i just left her with a burden to go on a vacation my physical recovery went slow which caused this to drag on for month of guilt and psychological torture when i wa finally healthy enough to move alone again i returned to my old job and so wa nearby to take matter back into my own hand nope she avoided me for month and would ignore me when i tried to arrange to resolve the situation then i wa finally able to get the matter off her hand but there wa still a balance i owed her that for month she would not let me give back to her i continuously asked for her banking information tried to meet her tried to leave it in a hidden spot for her to grab but she would ignore me every time last week i needed some important information from her her response wa i will tell you when you give back the money you owe me that s it this is when i lost all trust in her i had been desperately trying to fix my debt while she avoided me and now she had the gut to accuse me of being a freeloader there wa no way this wa not deliberate then it get worse bf come back to town and while thing are still messy we try to re establish a household together however she keep him away from me a much a possible and he always put her before me which at first i did not mind now i will go week without seeing him because he feel he owes her the attention after being away for so long especially since she is a widow never mind she sent him away so come the final straw i had a health relapse and needed his help with something i called him and asked for help but he wa over complicating it i can help but can t you just do it on your own i m sure it is not that difficult my mom need me here right now i ended up getting frustrated and angry and saying i felt i wa putting in all the effort in our relationship and ended it with f it i will deal with it myself yes i lost my temper i regret that then i hear her voice he wa on speakerphone i am disappointed in you sadgf you are manipulative and i see you have been emotionally controlling my son we need to work on your behavior and communication skill i panic and try to mutter an apology but she hang up on me i cried i called my parent i spent a few hour trying to figure out what to do when suddenly my boyfriend show up at my door thinking it is just him i open the door nope she is there we are here to help you she say i say thank you but it is too late now i will take care of it myself in the morning she then go on actually i want to talk i can see you have an imbalanced power dynamic and we need to sit down and discus this we need to work on how you two communicate i stare at bf in disbelief he say nothing no way we are not doing this she keep insisting she only want to help bf stand quietly giving no input they won t leave so i just say please go home i cannot deal with this right now it is too much and gently close the door they finally leave bf text me later nicely asking if i still need help i say no thank you he say ok and wish me a good night i have not responded since a couple of day now my mom think my bf ha no active voice in his own life and that i am wasting my life with him my dad say it is not smart to break it off just because of his mom a he is an amazing person on his own but this situation is taking a toll on my mental health i love him but the emotional stress of dealing with her while also dealing with my own health is too much i don t know if i can stay with a man who let his mom mediate his life and relationship and my trust in him ha broken since he allowed her to listen in to our conversation then come bully me at my door is there any possible way to salvage this relationship should i give up he say he love me but with her being a priority in his life and my own fragile health being a burden to both of them i m worried the effort might not be worth it maybe letting him go would free both of u but i m scared of hurting him and losing the best thing i have ever had amp x200b tl dr bf s mom ha been using a favor she did me to manipulate me emotionally for two year after my health failed all while bf wa working abroad and i wa all alone now that he is back she want to do an intervention to work on our communication issue because of a conversation that she listened in on without my consent bf is completely passive about it and i am considering ending thing over this,0
my 25 m girlfriend 23 f of 3 year went through my phone and found something she didn t like so context we were watching some spanish dating show where people call in to go on date with the people on the show one girl got matched with a really shitty guy that wa very manipulative the lady went though his phone cuz she wa getting weird vibe from him and found out that he s a pretty shitty person after all after that happened my girlfriend asked to see my phone and i gave it to her i thought she wa just going to go through my instagram like she usually doe but she went snooping around instead and found the app where i keep my porn now i m no prude or anything and i m willing to talk about my porn even though showing someone just how deep in the rabbit hole i go is embarrassing but i still don t like just having it readily available to anyone that go through my phone anyway she wa not happy to see i had a secret photo app she didn t know that s where i kept my porn so i guess i could understand why it would upset her but even after i told her that s where i keep my porn she wa still really angry that i had it maybe she didn t believe me idk my thing is i don t know how to feel right now i ve got nothing to hid besides my porn and porn habit but i still don t like her snooping through my phone i ve never cheated on her tho would anyone admit to it here and i m just not the type to do it i ve never had many friend and i m basically at home when i m not hanging out with her im not sure why she felt the need to go through my phone other than that lady on the show having a reason to do it added context i ve never been a fan of her asking to use my phone because i ve had bad experience with it in the past we would be driving somewhere and i d give her my phone so she can give me direction on where to go and i d catch her reading my conversation with friend or my mom or is go to the bathroom and when i came back she d be on my phone i don t have anything to hide but at least ask first and don t read my conversation with my parent that kind of stuff soured me on letting her use my phone but if she asks i still give it to her tl dr girlfriend found app i use to store my porn and is mad i have it,0

i don t know if i should cut off a friend who is trying to have a threesome with me and my boyfriend i don t know if i should cut my friend off who keep trying to have a threesome with me and my boyfriend last year i 24f lived with a girl 20f emma for three month we instantly clicked and hung out a lot because we were both new to the city she had shared that she wa bisexual and i had shared that i think i might be but that i wa not sure i have been dating an amazing guy 23m for the last year and moved out to live with him so while living with emma wa socially great i slowly found out that she can make some uncomfortable and suggestive remark i always let them go because i am not confrontational my family ha also always told me i am picky with friend so i wa trying to be le so and just give people a chance so here are some example of thing she ha done 1 when we were living together we went drinking one night she wa off that day and i had been working so i wa really tired and mostly sat at the bar while she wa dancing and getting to know people she gave her number to a couple of people and told me she is excited to explore her lesbian side on the way back home she put her head on my shoulder and said honestly i love you and if you are ever single i would love to take you out on a real date she wa very drunk and i am not even sure if she remembers it this made me very uncomfortable but i just laughed it off and let it go we have never spoke about it 2 one day we were making dinner at home and she wa talking about how she ha always wanted to do a three some and i wa like oh wow i would be so scared of the drama and she wa like don t worry it depends on the person like if i did it with you and you bf i think it would be fine and i laughed and said haha you are crazy and changed the topic 3 my boyfriend wa visiting me for a week we were doing distance then we were hanging out on the couch when she came home and showered she then proceeds to come to the living room with a very tiny towel on and just sits with u what and then a she get up her towel conveniently fall down which to me wa funny because although i knew it wa intentional i am secure in my relationship and don t really care but i do know it wa intentional because she doe this all the time in front of men she is very suggestive and flirty and play with line a lot 4 she got nipple piercings and a soon a i got home just proceeded to show her boob to me and asked if i wanted to touch i wa traumatized and refused 5 i moved to another country for four month to be with my bf and she asked to visit she basically suggested a threesome again and i just ignored it i know i am frustrating so i finally told my boyfriend about her flirting with me and he wa furious he confessed that he hate me being friend with her because she flirt with me a lot and i tried to be like noooo she is just young and doesn t know social line and he asked whether i would have felt the same if a guy behaved in the way she doe he also said that there have been time when she ha told him that he doesn t keep me happy she will steal me and have my baby 6 she ha time and time again told me i deserve better than my boyfriend who make me so happy because i don t look like i love him a much a he love me not true 7 she wa at my parent s house for my birthday and asked where the bathroom wa i showed her but for some reason she chose to go upstairs even though only two people had arrived by then and the bathroom wa free she came downstairs being like haha i wanted to hug your boyfriend in his underwear but he wouldn t haha apparently she barged in my boyfriend changing and asked to hug him and he said no he wa very upset about this last night i wa getting a drink with her and she told me that she got drunk and slept with her roommate who ha a gf and then said i feel like i wa assaulted and used the r word i obviously got super concerned and hugged her and she told me exactly what happened not r word i mean this is why people don t believe woman she basically said that she kissed him back and had fun but that she felt like shit in the morning i a politely a i could told her that while drink were involved people always get drunk and have sex and you can t claim it a r if you were in it at the moment she also laughed during this whole talk and made a joke that she would never sleep with my boyfriend so i shouldn t be worried she also ha std so i told her she really need to tell the guy s gf who she know but she doesn t want to i truly care for emma and i think she is a good person i have dismissed all her action a ah she is too young or still getting to know who she is or she didn t mean it etc my boyfriend ha never asked me not to hang out with her but ha expressed how uncomfortable it is for him to be friend with someone with such low morale i don t know if i should distance myself from this friend it ha been so uncomfortable comforting her about sleeping with a guy who ha a gf because i disagree with it so much amp amp have also been r ed and i hate seeing how accusation like this stack everything against woman we live in the building next to her so it might be hard to avoid her i don t even know if i should i am not someone who ever share crazy sexual stuff or make comment like that so maybe it isn t a weird a it seems to me i don t know how to go about this we have only been friend for like 9 month and it is already so much stuff tl dr one of my friend is constantly inappropriate and i am having a hard time ignoring it longer or giving her more chance to be suggestive,0
my 32m girlfriend s 28f type is very apparent and the fact that i fit it is making me feel bad about myself tldr my gf find my chubbiness attractive but her focus on the thing i hate about myself is making me uncomfortable especially when we re intimate so i love my girlfriend and i know she love me we ve been together for two year now and we rarely have any issue we re both child of divorce so we try to resolve issue before they become issue but for some reason i can t find the word to explain this particular issue to her i ve seen picture of my gf s ex and the men all have one thing in common they re heavier than average not obese or anything but they ve all definitely got a few extra layer i ve asked her about it and she just say that she like her guy soft which i am i suppose her best friend who i am good friend with a well confirmed for me that she like the teddy bear type i ve always had issue with my weight i wouldn t call myself fat exactly but i jiggle when i jump and i try not to go shirtless unless i absolutely have to i don t have the strongest chin so even a little weight gain give me a second chin and a i get older my face is definitely getting chubbier my gf doesn t bring it up in public or go around saying she s dating someone soft but i just feel weird about the fact that she love something that i hate about myself it get i don t want to say weird but it s a little weird during sex we re both very physical people but i hate having my stomach area touched and she like to touch me there a lot other people i ve dated usually don t do that or if they do they notice that i m uncomfortable and stop but my gf ha a mild case of autism most would call it asperger s but she doesn t like that label bc i don t think it s in the dsm anymore or w e so i know it s on me to tell her when i don t like something because even though she try hard to notice thing some thing slip through the crack i m usually okay with telling her when i m not cool with something but it s different when we re having sex i really wish i could just let her love me but i m just not sure i m comfortable enough with myself in this area at least yet how can i bring this up to her i have a bad track record of saying thing abruptly or in an insensitive way when i m feeling uncomfortable like this i really like her and i m not keen on messing thing up with her,0
i 41m need help navigating the relationship between my new wife 43f and adult daughter 19f hi reddit i m sure this is a tired issue to this subreddit by now but i need help i feel a lot of these issue are my fault i married my wife about 6 month ago after dating for four year throughout our relationship herself and my daughter never really got along at the time i couldn t place why they clashed but my daughter did seem like the antagonist my best guess is that she had a great relationship with the woman i dated before my wife it wasn t much of an issue until after she graduated high school a she didn t live with me my ex wife and i had an agreement that the child support i paid wa never renegotiated once i started making more money on the condition that i put our daughter through college my now wife knew about this and my daughter had been living with me already for a while before we got married my daughter did not want to move in with my wife s family asked if she could stay in rent the house she and i lived in together i felt bad for her but did not think she wa responsible enough to live alone her mother is extremely irresponsible and my daughter turned out well considering that but i just don t think she ha the life skill she told me that since she moved in with me my now wife ha been sending her all these message about money management and how to make it on her own book telling her to make a budget etc and to her it felt hostile but given my thought which i may have mentioned to my wife i m sure she wa trying to be helpful she went into this negatively and my wife in retrospect seemed to almost aggressively ignore the fact my daughter would be living with u once we got married since we moved in it s become a nightmare i m questioning my decision to blend our family quite honestly my wife imposes this rule on only my daughter where if you re caught with food outside of the kitchen you have to pay u the parent 10 my daughter doe work part time at a hotel but she also ha an internship and go to school full time she rarely ha time to eat with the family if ever and ha told me that my wife purposefully doesn t make enough for her anyway she also complains that my wife is constantly telling her to save x amount of money to move out but she can t do that if money s being taken from her daughter eats while she s out mostly but even if she ha food she s paid for in her room she bought a secret minifridge my wife want her to pay up i tell my wife that she paid me already whenever she come looking for money but it s bizarre my daughter isn t innocent either she hoard her trash in a bag in her room and say it s so my wife won t search what she throw away to see what she owes i m not sure if this is a rational response and she doe throw it away in her work dumpster on trash collection day but i understand why it freak my wife out but sometimes when my wife clean the house i feel like she look for reason to be mad at my daughter a her own kid room are filthy my wife also say my daughter is rude to her and make no attempt to bond with the family we don t charge her rent or anything and though she work and is at school a lot she s also home much of the time a she doesn t have a social life for some reason she doe seem to have friend at school but doesn t hang out with them often outside of that before graduating high school she wa a very popular but troubled kid and ha multiple suicide attempt in her past already i know she s complicated and hard to deal with and while my wife s behavior now ha me reeling i also understand that my daughter is probably bringing the worst out in her a her kid are very normal i don t know what to do i don t want to divorce my wife having my daughter live in our old house is no longer an option a i m letting a family from our church stay there and i m not sure i want her alone still either my wife would be livid if i put her up somewhere on our dime but my daughter only make about 800 a month and i know i ve said a lot of questionable thing about her but i m very proud of how she s turned thing around she s saved up a lot of money considering how little she make tl dr how can i help my wife and daughter are at serious odds and it s making them both anxious and mean my daughter is traumatized by therapy long story and would never go especially not with her or even myself and my wife is convinced she s not doing anything wrong anyway i feel like i have to mediate this myself and i have no idea how to do that,0

just found out my ex girlfriend is be abused in new relationship hello i d like to start off by thanking you for reading what i have to say and for any potential input i m26 split up with my girlfriend 23 of 3 year about 7 month ago we had lost our passion and both decided that it wa best to both do our own thing so we both seperated on good term with no hard feeling a nice change for once a while after she started seeing another guy she soon went off for the summer to work by the coast with him didn t hear much from her after that i wa concentrating on myself and would only hear little thing through mutual friend everything seemed good for her i wa happy if she wa happy near the end of the summer i started to receive text from her asking if i still loved her that she still loved me etc i will always have love for her she is one of kindest people i know and i will always admire that and what she ha done for me over the year but i am no longer romantically in love with her so the message stopped and i just thought to myself that maybe she isn t a happy a i thought september roll on and she is back in the city we live in living with the new boyfriend i see her a few time and she seems to be doing great happy and bubbly maybe she just had a nostalgic moment at the end of the summer and all is good october i start to see what i think wa the first red flag she had texted me something along the line of feeling like she wa being disrespected naturally a someone who care doe i tried to dig a little and find out the problem but i wasn t able to i left it there i didn t feel it wa my place to interfere and anyway i thought after our relationship we were also bestfriends throughout the 3 year if something wa really wrong she would always ask for my help saturday night she sent me a message around 5 30am explaining how she is in a very dangerous situation that she is being abused in every sense and now that she ha found help she need to get out that night she had spoken to her ex flat mate about it she told me she would like to move back in with me for a while i m still in the appartement we had together that she would feel safe but understands if it too much i will always have time for her she ha picked me up when i have been at my lowest so of course i agreed i reassured her once she wa awake again and she told me that she d been manipulated mentally and physically abused i obviously pushed her to get out of there straight away offered to come and pick her up and make sure everything would be ok she told me she would get an uber didn t want to make a situation and that she wa just getting her stuff together the evening came by and still no sign i asked what wa going on and she told me it s got a little complicated and she might have to do it tomorrow morning when he wa out of the house i wa not comfortable at all with this but without knowing the adress and her not willing to give me it i had to trust her judgement of the situation so this morning come and she tell me she is very ill she missed her lecture all day i saw her pushing this back once more so i urged her to get out of there and she did agree at first she told me she fell asleep and now ha too much work for uni today to be able to move her stuff and leave im trying to understand why wa it so urgent the other day to leave that she explicitly told me she wa in a very dangerous situation and now today it seems like it doesn t matter i wa thinking maybe he ha some sort of mental hold over her is she struggling to find the courage she did mention earlier that she wa scared gathering her stuff because he could hear her i am quite distraught about this situation and feel rather powerless she ha forbidden me from telling anyone a it is her story to tell a she put it i feel it only take one moment for something irreversible to happen and i couldn t live with myself if i just stood by and let it happen if i had the adress i would be there right now she ha promised me she will be out tomorrow morning but i have a funny feeling i will hear another excuse tomorrow morning what do you think i should do try get her parent to talk some sense to her police wait for tomorrow a im overreacting i seriously want to beat the shit out of this scum bag any guidance will be much appreciated thanks,1

my 26m fiance 25f planned our wedding by herself my fiance and i have been together just shy of two year and are getting married in about a month i ve had very little involvement in our wedding plan it feel like i m a guest who is just attending when we started planning this a few month ago not a big wedding but still a formal event my idea of planning wa u sitting at the table with a notebook and a computer making a task list making call together and it would be this project we did together but instead it seems like every so often we would talk and she would have done another thing talked to another person and set up another event and eventually there wa nothing for me to do and now that there s only a few last minute task that i m trying to help with or take over so she isn t doing so much she doesn t want me to because she s already got all of the contact information and plan in her mind and she want to do it herself she s done nothing wrong of course and i m not mad at all she took the initiative and took thing upon herself her being such a go getter is one of her best quality but i feel like this is one of those thing where i shouldn t have had to determine my level of involvement we should have just been talking and running idea past each other the whole time i don t know if i have a right to feel a sad a i do maybe i should have took initiative a well and just reported in i don t know i feel edged out of this experience and don t know if i have any right to feel bad you know because i didn t do anything i m trying to not sound like a lazy person in this i really wanted to have this experience together with her but maybe our idea of accomplishing a project is just much different tldr fiance planned our wedding by herself i thought i would have more involvement than i ve had do i have a right to be sad or should i just do better taking charge in the future,0

need to rant my partner 24 and i 21 have been together for 2 year and currently live together we recently 8 month ago moved into a new state after finishing college for work prior to moving we would get into fight here and there because we spent so much time together but i could always count on the fact that we would solve our issue and remain loving towards one another for later context i suffer from anxiety and depression i work in finance ib and my partner work in operation management prior to moving my partner wa super proud and supportive for me to have secured a job at a large global firm and we were both excited for the move thing got bad once we moved my partner s job is difficult but i have been degraded daily about my work because i work in an office where i don t have to be on my foot all day when we are home i am expected to do all of the cooking and household chore and when i explained that i wa exhausted from work they would reply with i know the shit you do at work it s not work or don t ever complain to me about being tired from work when you know the hour i put in or you complain a if you don t also live in this home i am expected to wake them up at 5am everyday even though i do not need to be up until 7 30 for my job my alarm did not go off one day and i did not wake up naturally until 5 30 i wa yelled at the second i woke them up being called selfish and being told i don t give a shit about them if i did i would have set 2 alarm this morning i woke them up at 5am a usual and wa greeted to a few minute later with yelling because they had turned the temperature up to 80 degree theyre sick the night prior and i had turned it down to 74 i explained i know you are not feeling well but i could not sleep with it that hot so i turned it down a bit they replied i can t go to work if i m sick you know that yet you still don t care i explained 74 still isn t that low and i already only get a few hour of sleep each night because the insomnia from my anxiety keep me up and i can t fall back asleep after 5am his response wa so get out sleep on the couch i don t care just do not turn the temperature below 78 you hear me this is my last warning i am not allowed to attend any work event or be seen with any of my work friend because they believe that my work friend are a bad influence because you don t need to go drinking with people you work with there is quite often alcohol during work event in my field or the team go out for happy hour on friday nothing too crazy i think i am not allowed to attend my firm s holiday party or any event after work hour yesterday a firm partner invited me over to his home for dinner along with some manager and a few associate i decided to go because it wasn t a drinking event and it s bad optic to decline an invitation directly from a partner i ended up leaving early because i wa so anxious on their reaction when i came home when i did i wa given the cold shoulder and wa not spoken to the whole night i m told you go to work do your work come home that s it i don t want to deal with bullshit after my day i better not hear about you having anything to do with your work people being in a new city that pretty much eliminates anyone i know outside of them month ago they were the one going with me to the doctor holding me when i wa having a panic attack and telling me this is a problem we will solve together now they see me curled up in a ball in a corner hyperventilating and walk by a if they didn t see everytime we fight they threaten to leave whilst yelling calling me a liar selfish and repeatedly berating me telling me i m doing this to them that it s selfish to have anxiety attack in front of them because it take up their energy too that i don t care how my action affect the people around me i m told my anxiety is my own doing if i just being negative all the time i wouldn t be going through all this that all i do is complain that it can all be stopped if i cared enough about myself or them when they notice me getting worse they suddenly stop going i ll put my ego aside because i don t want you to die i have that used against me several time a week really you re gonna complain do you know all the thing i wish i could do but i can t because i m stuck with you then leave me if it s that bad i can t you ll kill yourself i m tired i m hiding in bathroom at work to have my panic attack now at least daily i haven t gotten proper sleep in a while people around me have begun to notice i m mentally spaced out and i try to overcompensate by being even more cheerful and work even harder to seem like nothing s wrong i try to stay calm during conversation where they threaten to leave but they just keep going at it and my anxiety almost kick in automatically and i don t know how to stop myself from cry and not being able to breathe sorry for the long rant have you been in a similar situation if so how did you deal with it tldr my partner make everything my fault and it doesn t matter how hard i try i still end up being yelled at dealing with anxiety and depression,1
i m risking ruining my 23f relationship with my parent 50sm f for good over our cat 8f 7f 13m 16f my parent recently moved to the same city i live in it wa a haste decision made without consulting me my mom say the fact i live in that city ha nothing to do with me she just happened to find a job here but i know she wa actively searching keep in mind i live 300km away from where i grew up and my parent used to live so it s not like they moved to the next town i ve been living here for five year i wa upset that they didn t even ask what i thought of it because it mean losing a lot of connection and old time friend for me but at the same time it s their decision they justified it saying my mom desperately wanted to get away from her brother my uncle 40 m who used to live next to u for a long a i can remember there s been a tough and painful relationship between our family because of my grandfather s inheritance and my mom is downright scared of him she would start shaking and almost cry whenever one of u talked to him my mom is generally a nervous mess but she s especially difficult regarding my uncle he yell and get angry a lot and is overall definitely an unpleasant person but i do not know the reason why my mom reacts like that when i wa a kid she forbade me from playing in the part of our common garden in front of my uncle s house when i wa old enough to be home alone she would lock me inside the house and tell me not to go out at night she forbade me from keeping the window open because he could climb inside and so on i tried to ask the reason behind this behavior but apparently there isn t or i haven t been told any underlying trauma he did threaten to make u suffer once over issue with the inheritance now they moved in my city and they left our cat behind at first my mom said they were waiting until they were settled down then she said the two older one were too old to be moved then she said her tenant didn t allow pet which turned out to be a lie then she said the cat were sick and so they were difficult to care for i do not know if this is true but it struck me a especially cruel i have adopted a fiv cat a little more than a year ago and i live with roommate so i can t really bring 4 cat in my small gardenless home my parent current house is big and ha a garden when my mother wa coming up with excuse i told her we have to find a way and tried to convince her to bring them to the vet if they were sick or talk to her tenant if she didn t want pet etc she had a meltdown and told me she wa sick and tired of having to think of everything myself and then nobody s happy with my decision and that she doesn t want to take care of anyone anymore and said she wasn t going to come up with a solution or think of the problem anymore then she kept bringing up how ungrateful i wa and even at the table with family friend she complained that i am cruel to her and that i had told her she s a monster over this i literally didn t i wa right there a she said this in front of others i said that wa absolutely false and she said well i still have the message where you say the cat are part of the family a that wa the same thing this went hand in hand with many other argument about money and me being a spoiled child they also said it wa me who wanted the cat year ago at least the younger two so it s my problem now i thought we had reached a compromise where they would have my cousin care for the older two and bring the younger two in the new house but when we spoke of it again recently it turn out they hadn t asked my cousin at all and they just left the four of them in the old house because they are cat they find food on their own my uncle still life there she made me live my entire life in fear of him because she thought he wa willing to hurt a human child over the inheritance but think he won t hurt a cat i m about to start swinging i tried going back to the old house but my mom doesn t want me to go alone and she doesn t want to go back there ever again also i m a student and i have a job so it s hard to come up with the time for the trip too and unfortunately i don t even have a car i swear if i go back and something happened to the cat i m going to cut off my parent my mom obviously need therapy but won t get it and i m really losing my patience here and being painted a a spoiled needy child or whatever jesus just give them up to a shelter instead i love those cat what should i do tl dr my parent moved and don t want to bring our cat along for reason i don t fully understand and partly proved to be excuse when i try to find a solution i get shut down by my mom eventually she left them to their fate in the old house i don t know what to do,0

everytime the post what you looked a decade ago v now trend roll around i get really sad because my abusive ex made me delete all my old profile account when we were together i ll never get those year of memory back or get to see the progress i ve made because he decided i didn t deserve to have any social medium he decided that i needed to be cut off from the rest of the world because if i messaged anyone or posted anything it meant that i wa cheating on him and flaunting myself to other men he would threaten to leave me if i didn t delete all my account or at least delete all my picture post and i did because i wa only fucking 15 16 and thought this abuse wa somehow love i ll never forgive him for taking that from me especially since i have such a horrible memory that i don t even remember what i looked like what thing i enjoyed or what i ever posted about i wish i could scroll back on my old facebook and laugh about how cringey and young i wa back then but i ll never get to i just hate feeling left out of these thing just because i let someone control me that way,1
rant advice i think i ve been being groomed for the past 6 year so basically i began my freshman year of high school when i wa 12 year old started school early and i met a senior who wa 16 some background knowledge is that he ha bipolar disorder anyways we hit it off instantly we fell in love so quickly i felt like he wa the perfect person for me the age difference did bother him but we loved each other so we tried not to think about it when i wa about 13 or 14 our relationship started to change he would cheat and tell me about it he would get into these crazy mood and call me name b tch sk nk k ll yourself etc he d basically turn into a different person afterwards he d always apologize and say all the right thing he d beg for me back and say he couldn t live without me i knew it wa wrong and it wa destroying my heart but i loved him and i wanted to believe he loved me back so i always forgave him his occasional lashing out soon turned into constant emotional abuse he made my life a living hell sometimes he even made me want to k ll myself but i wouldn t leave i don t know why i just couldn t i believed he wa my soul mate i knew when it wa bad it wa bad but also when it wa good it wa amazing when i wa 15 we had sex for the first time we had the plan to wait till i wa 16 because of our age difference but we couldn t wait any longer after that our relationship wa great he wasn t lashing out he wa acting more romantic than ever before and he had stopped with the name calling i couldn t be more happier then one day he told me some news he had got another girl pregnant i asked him how far along she wa he said 5 month i wa heartbroken we didn t talk afterwards but 2 week later he begged me to come over so i did i stayed the night and had sex with him i still don t know why i did that either afterwards i knew i needed to stop talking to him it wa a very depressing and hard thing for me this wa in the winter then in the upcoming summer after the baby wa born he had sent me a picture of a paternity test it wasn t his it took time but him and i eventually got back together throughout me being 16 amp 17 there wasn t much to say we were together and happy most of the time he did occasionally have his episode but at that point in my life i wa just used to it and him being crazy didn t affect me anymore we broke up because of something stupid i don t even remember what it wa about when i wa 17 1 2 i got another boyfriend for about 4 month i only did it because i just needed to feel like i wa in a normal relationship for once we broke up and so my ex and i got back to talking i came over his apartment and i wasn t loving what i wa seeing he s dropped out of college twice can t hold and at this point dosent even want a job he s content selling drug out of his section 8 apartment for the rest of his life maybe that stuff wa cool and exciting to me when i wa 14 but were adult now and he should be doing more with his life it made me realize i want better for myself so i left early we got into a fight over text and he called me a stupid ugly sk nk and blocked me so flash forward present time about 5 month later i am 18 now he is 22 a few day ago he messaged me again apologizing and stating he can t stop thinking about me he said he wa on drug at the time but is clean now i promised myself i d be done but with him but a part of me know i still love him so basically the big question here is wa i groomed i wa only a kid and he wa an adult he took advantage of my emotion and emotionally abused me knowing whatever he did i would take him back i know im being manipulated but i m just not sure about being groomed i still do have a lot of mixed emotion he s basically the only boyfriend i ve ever had the only boy i ve ever loved i wa so young when we started dating i just feel like i know nothing else but this i feel like no matter what he doe i ll always love him after all that shit he put me through i still feel like he is my soulmate i ve tried doing research about grooming but i ve found nothing that touch on my type of situation thanks to anyone to read all this and heard me out,1
wife of 5 year say she want a break almost out of the blue this is by far the most painful experience of my life and i m having a hard time accepting it a reality wife and i moved to a new city a few month ago because she got in to a really good school she wa feeling a little lost a while ago and decided that going back to school to get a profession would help with it so i got a transfer and we moved here we lived here for a bit when she started to get really frustrated and upset by how bored and lonely she wa so she started hanging out with people at school and took up a hobby that she really enjoys during this time she started to get way too close to one of her classmate she had started a full blown emotional affair when i caught it i immediately spoke to her about it and she acknowledged she had been feeling depressed and forming this relationship wa helping her feel better we talked about it for hour and i even mentioned that this wa often the first sign of an imminent divorce which i absolutely did not want and she immediately made promise to seek out counseling and possibly go on anti depressant this seemed to make thing much better for a short amount of time once her other friend found out what she had done they started to distance themselves from her they said they wanted to take a short break from their relationship during this time she wa definitely upset but we got through it together and she started to feel better again for a short time in the last few week i started to feel that distance again but it felt so much different this time i couldn t explain it but it felt like a looking axe above my head she left for a week for a pre scheduled thing and visited her family in her home state for a while the whole time she wa gone she wa barely talking to me during the time i wasn t at work i would often send her picture of me cuddling our cat something we both do quite regularly but i rarely saw any reply that same dread wa in me but i tried to assume it wa just because she wa busy then today happened i felt it worse today than ever before and ended up leaving early to get home and see her on the drive home i called her and she said she needed to have a talk i asked if it wa a bad a i suspected and she admitted it wa so i urged her to just start talking i couldn t bare to wait through the drive she basically told me that she needed to take a break and work on herself that although she loved me deeply more than any one she d ever loved before she didn t think our relationship would make it to the long term when i asked for more information she explained that our personality are too different and our communication style are too different and she wanted to get back to learning about her individuality i told her that i highly doubted this would be a break and that it wa probably just a soft attempt at leaving me completely although if she truly believed that this wa just a temporary break and wanted to actively looking in to getting back together in some time then i would be willing to try it she admitted it wa unlikely to end up well so that s it 5 year of marriage we had our problem but we also actively worked on bettering ourselves for over 5 year we did so we had a healthier relationship than almost anyone else we knew our fight were calm disagreement and whenever we were hurt we would talk about it but this seems to have come out of nowhere can i blame this on the anti depressant is there anything i can say or do to keep her she s my best friend and if you had told me 3 month ago that i would be on the verge of getting a divorce i would have laughed at the mere thought of it how can thing go so drastically bad so quickly tldr wife of 5 year completely changed in the last 3 month want to take a break and most likely a divorce i m losing my best friend out of nowhere and i don t know what to do,0

when immigration is involved am i making the right choice see my post history for more detail regarding my abusive relationship with my husband to make a long story short my 26f husband 36m who is an immigrant and i got married a little over a year ago in hindsight getting married wa a massive mistake on my part he had continually said thing like if you really loved me and cared about me you would want to marry me so i can get residency status or why don t you want to marry me don t you want to help me don t you care about me he ha been verbally and emotionally abusive toward me for the last couple of year yelling gas lighting threatening me calling me a dumb bitch and a useless wife constantly accusing me of cheating saying nasty thing about my family criticizing me 24 7 etc he also ha a son from a previous relationship whom he apparently lost custody of when his ex threatened to tell the judge that he wa undocumented making him decide to back off and give her full custody so he wouldn t get deported and lose the chance to ever see his son again that s the story anyway at this point i m not sure if there s something he s not telling me so we did get married against my better judgement and earlier this year had started the process of getting him residency through an immigration lawyer but our relationship continued to deteriorate and the red flag kept waving my self esteem got shattered and i felt more and more miserable anyway i packed my stuff and left our apartment about a month ago after he threatened to destroy my car and got physically aggressive with me i want to finalize the divorce but he s been guilt tripping me saying if you divorce me i ll never see my son again do you want that on your conscience he insists we should just stay legally married but don t need to live together or see each other until the process of fixing his situation is over which could be a long a 2 3 year depending on the waiting list i just want to sever tie with him and be free but i feel bad because i don t want him to lose the opportunity to become a resident and gain back partial custody of his kid i know he s treated me like shit but i still feel guilty i hate the current political environment and hate the fact that immigrant are so demonized and despised in this country and he really did treat me wonderfully at time it wasn t always bad though i guess it never is so i m in a true pickle here i know asking stranger on the internet for advice regarding this sticky situation probably isn t the wisest choice but i need some somewhat unbiased and neutral perspective help please oh and i am seeing a counselor and have been talking to them about this conflict a well i guess i m just desperately trying to make the right choice here and need to talk about it,1
i 25f am arguing with my fiance 29m about boundary with his parent 56 f and 72m am i overreacting to this particular scenario i 25f have been with my fiance 29m for four year now engaged for a year at the start of 2018 right after i finished college i got an internship at a nationally syndicated radio show i excelled at the job and wa promoted to assistant producer in le than a year now for a 23 year old recent college grad with no real work experience beyond the foodservice industry this wa a pretty big deal i wa very proud of myself now let s back track a bit my fiance we ll call him jim is an only child his relationship with his parent is incredibly close they always talk about how they are their own little unit and that they exist in their bubble their word not mine they refer to themselves a the three musketeer constantly jim talk alot about how his parent never left him with babysitter never had true friend of their own never even really went out on date night a just a couple it s always been the 3 of them over the year i ve had to gently remind my jim that this is not necessarily the norm and we ve had to make certain adjustment and put up certain boundary with his parent i love his parent so much but they seem to forget that not every family operates the same way they do they didn t seem to realize that when a new person come into the family thing will inevitably change this is an example i m terrified of height last time we were visiting jim s parent they set up a day of rock climbing jim explained to them that height scare me they didn t take this seriously i ended up passing out while climbing when they realized the severity of my phobia instead of apologizing they just seemed extremely confused a if they genuinely couldn t understand why i wouldn t fall in love with rock climbing they love it so why wouldn t i i m not kidding from the look on their face you could tell they could not grasp how or why someone couldn t enjoy it here is another example my fiancé and his parent are obsessed with science fiction when i first met my fiancé he rarely watched anything else i m not the biggest fan of science fiction but i love my fiancé and so i found way to become interested i really didn t mind at all especially because he wa so willing to branch out from science fiction in return his parent on the other hand still revolve a large portion of their life around science fictionthey binge watch it on the weekend they go to the movie and catch up on the latest science fiction release family movie night it s going to be something science fiction related that doesn t bother me everyone ha their quirk what bother me is their reaction when non science fiction related medium is brought up we were staying with them last christmas and i suggested we watch a christmas film they couldn t even feign interest they tried but it wa obvious that it wa a painful and dull experience for them i ve also noticed that they re always sharing what s going on in their life and their career but they don t seem to extend that same courtesy to others my fiance s mom is a teacher at an extremely ritzy old catholic all girl school on the easy coast she also coach s her school s softball team we ll spend hour talking about her career and her life with her student but it s incredibly hard for me to get a word in about what s going on in my own life they dominate the conversation a few month ago our radio show wa given a pretty outstanding journalism award i wa interviewed on live tv i sent the link to the youtube video to a bunch of close friend and family member my jim parent responded with cool we ll check it out later i brought it up a few week later and it became quite obvious that they never watched in fact jim and i realized they hadn t listened to a single episode of the radio show whatsoever in my nearly two year there now a i d already felt some frustration regarding the lack of true respect i feel from my fiance s parent this one really hurt i don t need to be patted on the back about my work but for them to display such a blatant lack of care in my interest and passion when i m expected to constantly accommodate for theirs is a slap in the face jim wa quite disappointed in his parent too because he ha noticed this hypocritical tendency of theirs he s also frustrated because he feel is though his relationship with his parent is quite conditional often it is completely on their own term without any thought to the fact that we are adult with our own thought feeling and interest that are just a valid yesterday he got a call from his parent asking if we d like to order chinese with them stay in and watch a star war marathon my fiancé asked if i d like to go i told him to go ahead but i d be staying behind he asked why i responded with because i have absolutely no interest in spending my friday night watching star war once upon a time i wa willing to put myself out there and participate with these thing with your parent even though they don t interest me because i care about them and thought they d be willing to do the same for me but they ve made it incredibly obvious over the past few month that they are not willing to do so and so neither am i according to jim i m being petty and holding onto a grudge against his parent for the whole radio show debacle i don t understand how treating someone with the same energy that they treat you is holding a grudge amp x200b tldr my fiance s parent can be slightly overbearing and obsessed with their way of doing thing without giving any of the same courtesy to u my fiance doesn t seem to think it s nearly a big of a deal,0
question i have to see my ex almost everyday i decided to break the ice after a year since i ended now i m starting to think that could have been a bad decision i really don t know whether i should go back to ignoring him or continue a friend he said he s better now,1
my 23 f boyfriend s mom 56 f attacked me for wearing heel because it made me taller than her son 25 m i m 5 7 and my boyfriend is 5 8 sometimes when i wear shoe with heel i stand a tiny bit taller than him le than two inch height ha never been a problem in our relationship and he ha never complained about me wearing heel in the past recently though i wa his date to a wedding of a family friend i wore wedge sandal with a maxi dress and felt that i looked tasteful and appropriate however while we were taking picture my boyfriend s mom pulled me aside and told me i looked ridiculous in picture because i looked like a giant next to her son it really shocked me and hurt my feeling i didn t know how to respond so i stammered out an apology and went to the bathroom to regain composure i haven t brought it up to my boyfriend because he s a total momma s boy and think she can do no wrong when i ve brought up hostile pointed comment she ha made to me in the past he ha shut me down and written me off a reading into thing too much it hurt twice a bad because he s not only refusing to validate my feeling but also trying to imply that i m creating problem tl dr my boyfriend s mom make snide comment to me and my boyfriend won t acknowledge it i feel sad and alone how do i handle this,0
change and autoban info something on hate sub your thought welcome or ah shit it sunday again this is getting to be a habit i m gonna blast the new tool album and bust some reddit drama wide open open post anything go in the comment except personal identifying info this post is for transparency in the comment below you can post or comment anything but personally identifying info so all you troll go right on ahead and put in your two cent before you run out of change scroll past the gt stuff to skip me talking to hear myself talk about music and feel gt all blue word are youtube link and sidenote all the trigger warning because the lyric can get pretty disturbing gt if you came for the tune you can dial up the entire new album fear on spotify or youtube and yeah i sound like an ad but i am totally fangirling right now cause this is the first time i ve had the peace and quiet to absorb it holy flying fucking spaghetti monster take this shit and stick it in your ear hole music is incredible therapy and i don t know why but tool in particular ha always brought tranquility to my soul everyone is talking about descending but 7empest just damn gt i am dead serious on all the trigger warning rape sexual assault physical assault child abuse war and some all around disturbing imagery can be found on the song but some of it is disturbing and beautiful like and some of the song really resonate with those of u who have experienced abuse like make me sad and the make me giggle angrily it really a bit cathartic to blast that one and if you skipped all that at minimum watch this lyric video for fourtysix and i swear this band is my spirit animal gt if you have a song that help get your through you are welcome to post it below it sunday which mean i crank the tune go on a rant and do some house cleaning i wouldn t mind a few to add to my playlist k on with the show first we will be getting a new mod soon in the form of a bot that will auto shadowban user of entire sub this bot and others like it have been a point of contention on reddit for many year i myself have been on the fence but it come down to this or another 30 mod because this sub is about to get a lot bigger over the next few month it just reaching that statistical critical mass i don t know if this sub will be available to r all in the future but it likely reddit ha become a divided platform over the last two year or so with many sub turning into hatemongering far right the centrist that largely don t pay attention and others turning far far far left and going down the road to becoming equally toxic the admins have taken to removing the worst hate sub and putting the others in quarantine this hide them from the general public unless you are a subscriber bot have been created not by admins but by user to further separate this toxic racist and misogynistic cult from the middle ground and left base if you subscribe to one of these sub you are likely banned all over reddit on the most public facing subreddits if you are subscribed to this sub and need some help understanding the mind of a sociopath put a r in front of any of these sub name red_pill the original ce pit and jumping off point for abusive men and future abuser of america and around the globe and yes they are everywhere asktrp ask the red pill mgtow men going their own way which is actually men whining about woman incels now banned but for a long long time wa a petri dish crawling with user that openly advocate for the literal slavery public beating mutilation and murder of woman along with their own suicide literally a cult worshiping death irregardless of whose it is i wish to fucking twitter god i wa making this up some really toxic segment of thought have risen to the surface of the internet and reddit is one of the two main nesting ground you a a user of this sub should be warned about this movement because if your abuser is a user of reddit 4chan or just about any gaming platform they are already aware and use it a self justification in their effort to control manipulate and abuse you they don t see you a an equal human but a property and an unthinking animal they need to exert force over to get result this is unfortunate reality and it language is not just bleeding over to real life in the medium but is being led by mainstream medium looking at you fox news and pushed a political stance by our so called country leader i wish this belonged on a conspiracy thread but it real and it happening on public broadcast television news every single day you can check my post here for video that help explain it or see this twitter thread i found in r thebluepill for a more in depth understanding quarantining these sub and blocking the user doe not negate the fact that they exist and some will spend hour and hour making new account to troll with these are the same men that abuse woman in real life i hate that i can t stop all of it but i believe there is a long term benefit to shining a light on the existence of these hateful people this is who they are and how they see woman and really anyone that isn t ci white male and the sooner you replace the fantasy in your head with the stark reality of the sociopathic abuser you are dealing with the sooner you will strap on your running shoe and be out the door if you are already out it could help you let go of those last shred of sympathy and find that righteous indignation you never knew you had if anything in the world i have ever written can sum up how i got over my abuser how i stayed away and how i know i will never fall for another abuser bullshit this is it i see some woman right sub getting just a bad is it backlash the pendulum of culture picking up speed is it the frustrated incel troll who lost their community and suddenly found they had useless account that were banned everywhere else one redditor tried to trace incel activity and concluded that several hundred account were shill or bot account and only about 40 or so were actual human user sub like thefairersex are following that same pattern but calling for woman to hate men in the same militant fashion what doe this mean for this sub it going to be nearly impossible to grow this sub if it need to go private many people will feel shut out no matter what if it public abuser have already found and harrassed their victim on this sub being open and vocal is the solution to long term abusive culture being vocal about it is best way to recover talking about it is the best way to let go and leave talking about it help others too but the downside to sharing your story is that your abuser may find it and harm you in retaliation or may mock you or a troll may do so or some deranged internet incel may track you down because thing like that are the reality we live in today being silent can help when you are in it leaving start in your own mind and heart you don t owe it to anyone to warn them you are leaving i decided to leave month before i did i didn t feel able when i did leave it wa hour between that mental commitment and action some people aren t a lucky a i am maybe your window of opportunity will involve a moving truck and some friend maybe a police standby maybe you should get your go bag grab your phone key and tell your abuser you are heading to work or ran out of milk and then never go back okay end rant for the day i have stuff to do this is whats happening this is what my option are if you see another or better way let me know and i will be back later,1
venting my abusive family amp abusive partner i hope this is okay to post here a i can t see anything saying otherwise nearly all the post here are about dealing with an abusive partner relationship but i want to share my story of an abusive family relationship i am an adult and have been out of my bad family situation for a long while now but i just want to essentially vent about what i have had to go through growing up due to some health problem which i will go into later i have trouble with memory but will do my best here i did not have a good time growing up both of my parent were alcoholic and would beat and neglect me regularly i wa the eldest of two child and for reason i still don t know to this day my sibling wa rarely if ever subjected to abuse i cannot remember anything prior to around the age of 5 or 6 but my own earliest memory is of one of my parent throwing a glass wine bottle at me with intent to hit me i wa told that a a baby one of my parent tried to throw me out of the car while it wa moving a i wa cry more coherent memory that i have involve being beaten to the point of busing and blood often i wa not fed due to my parent choice not because of any financial difficulty when i did something they did not like i wa locked outside in the weather to sleep without shelter or any comfort i wa not allowed birthday to to celebrate anything my sibling did a i wa told that my very presence ruined event i spoke to my school councilor at the time and on several occasion they saw the harm on my body and called my country child protective service nothing ever came of it when i wa about 10 i had a friend over i forget what wa wrong exactly but something with the dinner that night did not agree with my stomach so i didn t finish it my mother in full view of my visiting friend grabbed me by the ankle and dragged me to the floor in the process i hit my head rather hard on the floor she locked me outside for the night which wa semi regular my friend wa then told to leave and removed from the house luckily she wa able to get in contact with her parent to get her on another occasion it wa about 40 degree celsius outside and i wa burning my foot a i did not have shoe i went to my mother and asked for 5 for some simple shoe so i wouldn t burn my foot my friend who i mentioned previously wa with me again that day my mother locked u both in the industrial freezer at her workplace we had to call the police to come and get u out when i got home that night she wa furious and proceeded to kick me the 12 year old child out of her house onto the street where i lived for the next 2 year luckily where i live ha some free doctor available so i wa able to get some help about a year into being homeless i wa diagnosed with depression at around 14 year old i reconnected with my same friend and ended up living with her for about a year unfortunately getting raped by their older brother friend more stuff happened with this but i won t go into it towards the end of that year i had a mental breakdown and wa sent to a mental hospital and ended up getting diagnosed with psychosis later schizoaffective disorder after this point i wa by myself again and ended up living in a basement for cheap rent i tried to reach out to my family and explain what i had been through and seeing if they wanted me back i wa naive and wanted their love even after how they had treated me they blamed everything on me and acted a though any young child deserves to be treated the way i wa my sibling still defends them to this day and i think that is what hurt me the most i tried to explain my mental health issue to them and i wa told the typical you re just sad and get over it thing that people say my first real partner wa also abusive a lot of the warning sign i completely missed a i had seen these thing a relatively normal he would punch hole in our home throw thing at me with force and break my belonging all the while saying thing like i break these thing so i don t hurt you i would never hurt you after nearly 6 year that eventually turned into hurting me he grabbed my hand and bent them at the wrist with such force that 2 year later i still cannot use my hand properly and only have 2 fully functioning finger per hand still i stayed the physical abuse got worse and eventually i moved out with a friend to be close to my place of study in reality i wa not studying and wa moving out only so i could then leave him without fear of my well being because of my garbage family i never got to finish school developed several quite sever mental health problem and genuinely struggle to function most day i am now 23 and trying to get medical help for some of the issue caused by them i ve since been to specialist and been told i am autistic have ptsd social phobia and am still struggling with depression and obviously the schizo stuff a it lifelong these thing cause really extreme memory loss and problem for me a well a a slew of other issue i still want to try and reach out to them but i know it s for the best that i try and avoid having any contact with them on top of the already mentioned mental health problem it also affect my life today i have a great relationship with my partner but i struggle to understand and deal with regular and what would seem like simple concept of relationship this is my first real and healthy relationship after year of abuse and trauma i don t even know how to genuinely connect or speak to my partner i genuinely feel myself feeling more lost and alone because of the previous trauma

i 27 f am seeing a lot of red flag with my husband 36 m i d like to preface this by saying this is the only form of social medium i have that he doesn t stalk and that s because he doesn t know my username and deleted his reddit we have been together for 6 year i deleted my facebook and he thought i had just blocked him he search me he google my name he google variation of my name he found my myspace from when i wa 12 that i can t remember the info to delete my instagram is probably his home screen i deleted a bunch of selfies because it seemed pointless to have but i posted one and he asked about it like why are you posting selfies if i m on my phone which is often yes my mom text a lot my sister text a lot and my best friend and i talk all day he go your mom your sister roberto like asking who it is i m talking to he s on his phone all day playing game why doe it matter if i talk to my fucking family there s this shit stain named angelo that i dated and he wa blocked from everything i have but used his work phone to contact me i politely told him to delete my number blocked that number and immediately told my husband so he wouldn t think i wa hiding anything well apparently when i made my instagram public for all of four second angelo wa able to find it and add me i did not see this and my husband go onto the instagram he made for our dog lol and said why is he following you and i literally handed him my phone cry my eye out with my list of follower and said his name is not there he is blocked ig can glitch take my fucking phone and he did realize it wa a glitch and i am not secretly talking to that scumbag on ig but i m sure he think i am elsewhere i hate angelo i didn t even tell my husband that angelo texted me from multiple friend number i didn t answer i blocked every one but my husband will just think the worst of me so why even tell him at this point fucked if i do fucked if i don t my husband wa clingy from the start of our relationship i worked a a bartender and he showed up to nearly every shift which seemed like a sweet gesture at the time at my latest job he showed up to ton of shift i wa working a well he always made it seem like he wa visiting because he felt i wa having a bad day but truthfully i think he just didn t believe i wa there one time i wa leaving work after close so he wasn t coming to visit and i drove right by him i guess he wa coming to check if my car wa in the parking lot it s a if he is looking to see if i am where i say i am and it is beyond exhausting he ha absolutely no trust or faith in me whatsoever if i am going to see a friend i can expect an attitude my best friend is a male we have been best friend for 10 year there is nothing going on there there will never be anything going on there and he ha met and hung out with him multiple time but he always make comment and pointed remark then he try to seem really upbeat and supportive because he doesn t want to come off a controlling but at the end of the day i know my husband and i think he always belief i have one foot out of the door and going out with friend is going to push the other i feel like my entire life is controlled because no matter where i go or what i do i should be home instead i feel like i am constantly being watched and checked on i feel like i cannot go anywhere to breathe if i m out i absolutely feel obligated to check in multiple time i wa watching basketball with my best friend and i sent him fucking video of the tv there s a huge difference between saying hey i m safe i love you and feeling the need to prove i am where i am i always get an attitude when i get home too if i try to talk about it he denies it i went to a halloween party at a lesbian friend s place and he completely stalked her social medium made ton of joke about the girl looking at me like every single thing in this world is a threat to him and our relationship i used to have a social life i used to have friend i ve been trying hard to get that back but when there s absolutely no trust or faith in me it make me feel guilty a shit about going out i remember when we lived in our old house i wa going out to take one of
