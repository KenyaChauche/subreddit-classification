be aware i have banned several fetish porn account and a few scammer in the last week you should always check comment history before going into private chat and you should use the report button if you think something is off i just banned someone they made a post to discus healthy relationship but the comment section wa pretty empty not a lot of discussion going on and then when i check the post history it some dude thats posted in all sort of dating sex chat sub including post asking for sexting do i have to post a weekly reminder of how disgusting some people are that some people post here to feed their degradation kink and some because they know there are vulnerable and lonely people on this sub that might not recognize the red flag you a a member or lurker in this sub hopefully don t notice the sick individual that like to play out their fetish fantasy but i know i haven t caught a lot of it because im working 60 hour a week i do my damnedest to skim over this sub when i have a few minute some day it hard to look at this sub at all because i can t handle the reminder of my own past abuse it turn my stomach how these disgusting selfish porn addict can t summon up the barest hint of empathy and go to a sub that actually caters to their fetish addiction considering how much of reddit is porn kink fetish and just generally cater to horny people you would think they could leave this sub alone but if you are here you should be able to acknowledge that depravity and lack of empathy are unfortunately common oh yeah please also report any suspected scammer if you are willing to donate please donate your time cash or useable good to your local domestic violence or homeless shelter do not do it here,1

my 30f husband 36m didn t tell his work of 10 year that he wa married sorry had to resubmit this and add our relationship length we have been together 9 year sorry if you already commented on my first submission so i m basically looking for advice on if i should even dig into this further what i should do now and if this is normal basically the short version of the story is that i went to drop my husband off a lunch at work i have never done this in the entirety of our relationship because i have always worked during the day but i recently changed job and i have a lot more spare time now we have been married for 9 year i decided it would be really cute and different to surprise him so i packed up a lunch and headed off to his office now i know this sound slightly strange but i actually have never been to his office before i mean i know where it is and i ve waited in the car when he needed to go back for paperwork at night or something like that but i ve never actually gone in during business hour mostly just because i ve never had a reason to quick background on the husband he s a lawyer he s been with the firm for 10 year now he love his job but he also love his down time we haven t gone to the christmas party yet because apparently they charge 50 buck per ticket and it s a high end venue we re saving for a house so we decided to skip it just little thing like that that have just culminated in me not being there i ve been out to bar with a few people that are his work friend but he did tell me that they try not to talk shop out and leave work at work so the few time i ve met them they didn t really mention work anyway basically just giving the background on why i haven t ever gone to his office he doe love his job but he s not super duper involved and their office doesn t do a ton of outside of work social stuff so i just don t really have a reason to be close with his work people i guess so i go into the office and i say to the receptionist mind you i m changing name here hello is paul around could you tell him that his wife is here with his lunch or can i just go back and find him she look surprised and say paul ha a wife super confused i just smiled assuming she wa new and said yup here i am haha is he busy she picked up the phone and i just stood there after a fee moment she whisper hey paul your uh wife is here oh oh okay okay okay sure thing she then hung up and said paul will be out in a moment hun i stood around for a few minute and my husband suddenly appeared and exclaimed samantha wow you re here you re such a prankster and gave a super fake laugh took my hand and hurried me out the front door back to the car he basically took the lunch kissed me said thanks and that we would talk later and rushed back inside i felt like what he said wa super weird i went to the firm s website a i sat in the car and see that the receptionist ha been there since they began the firm 16 year ago i felt super strange about it and decided to go back in i forgot to give him his soda and wa just going to leave with the receptionist and then leave when i went back in she must have been in the toilet and a different man wa standing at the desk i said hi can you tell paul he left his soda in the car i m just dropping it off he smiled and said oh wow lucky guy good girlfriend to be dropping him off a drink hey nice to meet you i said i m his wife actually i started to feel weird about it he scrunched his face and said paul paul smith i confirmed yup paul smith fake name he said pauly ha been here for 10 year i think i would have met his wife anyway yea i ll tell him and he gave me a weird look i felt super uncomfortable and decided to ask for the work friend from the bar i quickly said um is andrew in he said um we don t have an andrew here are you sure you re in the right place i just decided to leave and said i think so anyway tell paul i left his drink i went home feeling so strange about the whole thing am i overthinking this is it normal that he just wouldn t have brought me up what should i ask him is this normal he doesn t wear his wedding ring almost ever even right after we got married it just feel heavy and irritates his finger so we might buy a tactical wedding band but just haven t done it yet i guess no one would see a ring because of this when i asked him about it he said he wa busy and didn t have time to talk about it right now he left for his poker night and i m just home feeling strange about everything their office is closed tomorrow so we will have all day to talk about it but i don t even know where to start tl dr my husband didn t tell anyone at his job of 10 year that he wa married and i feel strange about it,0

major fight with husband 26m over my 25f birth control i am childfree always have been since i could understand the concept of having child and i always will be when i met my husband he wa on the fence i made my stance exquisitely clear told him within a few week of dating that no child would ever be springing from my womb and if that wa a problem then we could never be serious he put a lot of thought into it and after we had been dating several month told me that he would absolutely rather have me than any possible offspring i wa sure to check in with him regularly to make sure he wa still ok with this i understand people change their mind and i wouldn t have held it against him we would simply have broken up he reassured me at every turn that he wa fine not having child and i wa his world the last time we had that conversation wa after we got engaged and i haven t asked since when we were early in dating we had issue with intimacy he could not keep an erection and it wa pretty obvious that the condom we were using were the reason we d get hot and heavy with no problem but a soon a the rubber went on he d get soft i offered to get on birth control so we could ditch the condom i got a nexplanon implant and that wa that my period were horrible but i thought that wa about it i kept the implant for a full 3 year and had it removed last year i cannot describe how much better i feel i m happier my period are better i lost weight that i hadn t realized i gained because of the implant i m more attracted to my husband and initiate sex far more often i didn t realize i hated that damn implant until i got it removed my parent s insurance dropped me for reason i won t get into i intended to get a mirena iud after having my implant removed but without insurance i just can t swing it we ve been using condom appropriately sized this time no issue with erection since husband had been reminding me regularly to get on a student health insurance plan offered by my university so i can get birth control worked out but i ve been hesitating because it s so expensive i m also hesitating because i really don t want to go through all that again i can t believe how miserable i let that implant make me and i m afraid of doing it again husband ha actually commented that he is so happy now that i m happy again he ha outright stated that he love that i initiate sex more often and seem more attracted to him i have told him i think the implant wa the reason but he is convinced that it s because my school program is le intense this year and i m le stressed well here come the fight he reminded me once again that i need health insurance and should look at getting the school plan i expressed my concern at the expense but he countered that he is willing to pay for it and i shouldn t worry he then asked me what i had decided on birth control i expressed my reluctance to do anything hormonal again and i don t want paraguard copper i m not signing up for worse period and cramp i told him i really wished i could just find a doctor who would sterilize me i m only 25 so it s not likely but if that could happen it would take care of everything no condom and no baby he absolutely blew up he went on about how i couldn t do that and that i wa taking a decision away from him i wa floored because he made that decision when he married me i wasn t taking anything from him i told him i don t want child and he knew that before we were married asked him why this upset him so much he said i wa taking away his coping mechanism i told him if he want child he need to find a different woman and he took that a me threatening divorce this say to me that really deep down he want kid and hope that i will change my mind or that we ll have an accidental pregnancy this is crazy to me because we had a drunken mistake very early in our relationship that resulted in the what would we do if we got pregnant conversation i told him i would want an abortion and asked if he would support me in that he said he would absolutely support me a long a he wa allowed to be a little sad of course i agreed he s always allowed to be sad about thing a long a he doesn t take it out on me i m kind of lost here we ended the talk with some terse i love yous and haven t spoken about it since everything since then ha been normal i guess a long a i m not taking action on my sterilization plan he is ok pretending the conversation didn t happen i m pretty upset i want to be sterilized and have consequence free sex with the man i love i m not willing to put my body through hormonal hell again just so he can pretend we might one day have child and i m also not willing to suffer knowing my husband secretly might want kid but won t tell me how do i bring this up again what

i have a serious question i m extremely embarrassed to say this but i ve been in an extremely mentally and emotionally abusive relationship for the better part of a year and a half this woman ha tormented me chased away friend and wouldn t even allow me to see my family at one point she would threaten to call the cop on me if i ever tried to leave and when i d threaten to call the police she d start punching herself in the arm and leg and say who are they going to believe you or me this lead to me having to record our argument which she knew i wa doing and i ve still managed to record her screaming at me for making plan 2 week in advance that didn t involve her and her whipping me repeatedly with a cell phone cable because she wa angry i ve recently made plan to move away and begin my life a new without her i m planning to empty the apartment of only my possession while she s working and move approximately 20 hour away i ve written a note and i ve already spoken to our landlord who is going to give her the option to move out instead of being stuck with all the bill if she want i ve written a letter to her parent containing a flash drive of all the argument i recorded and plan on mailing it the day i leave so she can t cry wolf to her parent i ve done everything in my power for this woman to realize that i m a good man but she s always allowed her anger to cloud her judgement and every argument we have i am required to explain myself a hundred time in the most rational tone i possibly can because if i raise my voice higher than that of a golf announcer i m yelling at her now that you ve got a very vague backstory here s my question is it normal to feel extremely guilty although she s been horrible to me lately it tear me apart thinking about what she s going to be feeling when she come home and i m gone,1
my boyfriend 28 doesn t like my choice to not shave my boyfriend and i haven t been dating too long like we haven t even had full sex yet and i know a lot of people on reddit like to cut to the chase and say break up with him but i don t want to just break up with every single guy who ha a flaw that bother me id rather work this out first before even considering saying hey i want to break up because you don t like my body hair i usually don t shave my leg unless it s summer it s winter now so it s not like i m wearing dress or short anyways so i obviously have leg hair and i don t know if it s because of my ethnic background or not jewish russian ukrainian that sorta area but my hair is dark and it make it look like i have more leg hair than i actually do i showed my boyfriend my leg hair and the first thing he said wa it s so hairy like a man which hurt my feeling because i m a woman so it s not hairy like a man it s hairy like a woman he asked if i shave and i said yeah usually in the summer but i don t like shaving my leg it take so much time and he said well you ll shave around me right and i wa like i don t know maybe if i feel like it today i decided to stop shaving i felt inspired by french woman i know a lot of french woman do now shave though but i liked the idea that they go all natural i thought hey it grows for a reason why should i shave if i m going to shave my leg and vagina i might a well shave my eyebrow and head usually i shave my arm stomach crotch and armpit and mustache but i don t know if that count but i told my boyfriend that i ve decided to shave nothing except my mustache because i really don t like that and i told him he can support me or not say anything and he kinda just rolled his eye i wa being pretty enthusiastic about it in my opinion smiling and everything but he didn t care now i don t know if he just prefers no hair on his woman but he told me at first that he is looking for a long term relationship to settle down with and how can you be looking for something serious and then also be frustrated by natural body hair and he s 28 so i think he s being pretty immature by being shocked by the fact that i have body hair i don t know how to look at this whether he pout and cry or not i m still going to stick to my gun and not shave but it hurt my feeling knowing he might think i m gross or that it bother him secretly i wish he d be supportive or at least not care because after all i m wearing jean and long sleeve everyday you can t even see my body hair if you tried and the only time he will see it is if i m going to take my clothes off which at that point doe any guy care about whether you got hair on you or would they rather just get to the point my boyfriend is asian from taiwan and i don t know if most woman there shave everything and that s what he s used to but he s into white woman so id assume he should also be prepared for white woman s body i just want him to like me for me and like all of me including my body hair or at least not be open about what he doesn t like about me it s not like i d point out that i don t like his body hair or haircut or something like that but i really do like all of him i think he s not being very adult about this or maybe i m blowing it out of proportion tl dr my boyfriend 28 think my leg hair is hairy like a man even though i m a woman so how is that possible and is acting immature over my choice to not shave anything but you can t even see my body hair because it s winter unless you get all my clothes off he told me he want to settle down so am i wrong for thinking he s acting immature for being grossed out by a small thing like my body hair,0

would it be weird to gift my 24m close female friend 23f a laptop i got free and don t need should i ask her boyfriend 23m who is also my close friend if it s okay i don t particularly need it and since i got it for free it would feel unethical to sell it she doesn t have a great computer right now so i figure she can get the most use especially since she like to play a lot of game with her boyfriend very ldr i m questioning myself since i came out of a long term relationship with someone very insecure who i m sure would ve had a problem with this it s been hard for me to determine what s normal even though i ve known her for 3 year and him for 10 year tl dr wondering if it s awk to gift my close but completely platonic female friend a laptop,0

update not sure if my 32f boyfriend 36m is cheating or if it s a misunderstanding so we talked about the post he seemed confused and said he hadn t seen the facebook post when i pointed out that he had liked it he said he didn t remember doing it and asked what it said i told him that the post were highly suggestive that the two of them were a couple i said that i work to be very supportive and respectful of her role in his life but that the post made it seem like she didn t show the same respect for my role in his life he agreed and that he must have liked it on accident that he shouldn t have done that and that he would talk to her i asked him to let me know how it go all is fine because i m confident he ll take care of it that wa two week ago a couple of day after christmas his ex wa driving his kid up to see him for new year he work out of town and since i hadn t heard anything from him about talking to her and the post and comment were still up i brought it up again i sent a message letting him know that while i trust him to handle it i wa uncomfortable with her coming up there without having it resolved and that at the very least i d like to know when he would talk to her so i get a series of short message i have to drag out of him but he say he talked to her but he d ask them to take them down when i ask what she said he say she just said okay so i text him so you said they weren t appropriate and she just said okay and he say essentially so now what i d like them taken down because they re a blatant slap in the face to our relationship and yet again i m leaving it in his hand to take care of and he say he will well while his kid are in town he get sick so we don t have the opportunity to follow up or talk about anything once the kid leave and he s feeling a little better we re texting and i bring it back up how i hate being left in the dark and that i m starting to feel really uncomfortable with the lack of communication and transparency i send him a long text spilling my gut about it he open it and suddenly just stop replying he left that message on read for two hour before i ask him if he s fallen back asleep turn out his kid caught what he had and he s driving out of state that alone i m fine with but i told him he could at least have sent me a message to let me know and his response wa just that it wa last minute it s an 8 hour drive he can t use siri to send me a short message to let me know we ll finish the conversation later i tell him that this is really important to me and i really want to talk about it soon his reply what s the issue exactly and at that point i tell him that i ve said all i can possibly say through text message and that we need to talk on the phone so now his kid have been sick for the last week we haven t talked he s super hard to get a hold of and the two day he said he d probably be able to call he hasn t i tell him i feel like i m begging him for his time he tell me i m being silly and that he ha 3 sick kid and that it s been all consuming we re going on two week now that this ha been hanging over u i have a child i m not mad that he s taking care of his sick kid at all but i m really upset about our communication over the last couple of week we need to talk about it but i can t get hold of him to talk about it i haven t been sleeping well and i can t stop thinking about it and i keep trying to convince myself that it s all just bad timing with trying to resolve this and everyone being sick but the ongoing lack of communication is really starting to make me wonder if there s something going on i ve been waiting around for him to talk to his ex about these post that make them seem like a couple because i really need him to stand up for our relationship a little here but i m getting nothing from him at this point i really want to message her directly and talk to her about it but i m so deep into it i don t know if it s a good idea am i out of line i texted him today the kid are getting better he looking for a place to stay in the next state he s working in he s been posting article on facebook so i know he ha some free time i ve been trying to keep myself busy but this is really really important to me and it s hurting my feeling that he seems to be ignoring me how long is appropriate to wait for thing to level out before i sort of put my foot down about having this conversation since he s not talking to me about it is it worth going right to his ex to talk about the actual post tl dr we haven t been able to resolve an issue in two week due to lack of communication he say it s because he s been sick and then taking care of his sick kid but i have a nagging feeling he s trying to avoid talking about it am i overthinking it,0

6 month of dating my catholic so 28m and i 22f am fed up and want to leave am i doing the right thing or being too impatient i know catholicism tends to be strongly looked down on but i really need advice that won t judge the situation simply because my so is catholic and i m not we have been friend since october of 2018 and have been dating for 6 month now i m not catholic but i m not against anything he want to do in life due to the catholicism catholic wedding going to mass weekly raising child catholic i know no sex is a big one but i am asexual the big thing for me is sleeping next to my partner i feel alone and like i am not in a relationship if i can t even sleep next to the person i love this ha been a big argument for the last two month he is hyper focused on the thought of scandal which i understand is important to avoid in his religion but the bigger concern is intent since i never want sex the mutual temptation that would lead to sin is not there side note i don t mind sex i just don t care i do want kid in the future so i am of course going to want to have sex eventually for that purpose alone even though he know that it doesn t seem to matter because it s look scandalous for a man and woman to sleep in a bed together and he want to be a good role model to others i ve talked to him about this every which way and last night now he did try to sleep with me but 3 hour later he sits up in bed randomly i asked him twice what wa wrong and he completely ignored me and then proceeded to get up and lay on the floor to sleep me emotional and still barely awake get out of bed and go to the living room to sit on the couch because i don t want to even be in the same room with him at this point i just feel really alone over this like i m not even in a relationship we have no problem outside of this stupid sleeping next to each other thing and i seriously don t care about all of the other thing that come with his religion even though i know at least one person is still going to make a comment about it i feel stupid for this post but i just need some kind of opinion outside of our opinion and my sister i wa considering posting this on the catholic sub but i m not sure how that will go tl dr bf is catholic and nothing interferes with our relationship or jeopardizes our future except for the fact that he currently will not sleep next to me in a bed at night due to his fear of it seeming scandalous to others it s 4 01am on christmas and i just feel alone and frustrated am i being too impatient or is this the end,0

ex husband is absolutely insane when do i get into mediation and address all the missed visitation and abusive threatening text and call i had no option but to divorce my 7 year old father it s only been since late july 2018 since i finally got him out of the house the divorce wa final sept 6th since he had not full filled the suggested visitation scheduled outlined in our decree he had the judge sign off on a special request to change the standard schedule to allow him one overnight on wednesday s on his off weekend week i agreed and the judge signed it he hasn t fulfilled a wednesday yet i have so many excuse in texh from him work can up or the one he ha used very frequently is i am sick literally calling in sick from being a father i have been more than easy to work with i haven t made a big fuss about any of it i just don t tell my child they have plan until i know he isn t going to flake which is aggravating because i am doing all i can to provide a health him and consist schedule for him which my ex doesn t respect one bit so wednesday the 5th wa to be a overnight he texted me he wa sick so he asked if he could do thursday i said ok then can t do thursday another excuse then he asked can he do friday night because he had missed plan two day in a row i wasn t happy about this because i wa really looking forward to being off work and him being out of school i really enjoy our friday s but i also want him to keep his relationship with his dad so i said ok fast forward to last night he hasn t seen him but facetime since of course he couldn t do the wednesday so i texted him around noon yesterday and said since i have my friday last week how about i keep him this friday night then he can do the rest of the schedule a planed i really didn t even think twice about this first time i had even asked for any type of change it s always him asking and me agreeing so apparently this trigger him to completely lash out with name calling and threat it is so frustrating still having to deal with his total delusional thought process i have kept my cool and honestly i am just sick of it my child and i were in the middle of our nightly routine i had my kid in my bath and i wa literally stepping into the shower i see my phone and his text telling me i am coming over right now to see him and we are going to work this schedule out i said well we are in the middle of bath and shower that s it i get out of the shower to see my phone lite up with all sort of text with threat and name calling telling me i am a bully i am getting a family friend attorney to take you down called me a liar and the really odd one a druggie i wa thinking this guy ha lost it i mean i have been nothing but very easy to work with in having to deal with him so i called him and said ok i see all these threat what is this about him i feel you are always bullying me ok how well you have all the control i wanted to stop by i said well we also have our daily routine can t you respect that also i asked about these threat he tried to say they aren t threat but they clearly are and documented i said so what do you want to take me down and go to court about he said i am denying him his friday i quickly pointed out how many time i have been agreeable and he had him last friday i want to spend time with him this friday this is unreasonable at all to me a sane person so i even took my request off the table and said ok if this is making you so upset i will just give you themis friday too he then quickly say nope to late now i am working so he didn t even really want the friday crazy so i asked ok you want to take me down and go to court what are you wanting changed he say what do you mean wtf i said well do you not want him in my care anymore what are you wanting he had no answer i said so what are you wanting to take me down about he literally didn t know i asked about his comment he said i am a liar because he say i agreed to scratching the wednesday s he special requested and had jude he sign i agreed to giving him all friday instead which never happened i did say i would work with him i never once said i would give up every friday to yet again work around what s convenient for him i would never say that also i don t take drug nothing at all i don t drink i don t smoke i asked him about this he again had no real answer he had got into my thing right before the divorce and saw i had a prescription for hydrocodone 28 pill i had for three month sitting in my work desk cabinet for my horrid tmj pain that i get every once in awhile and he stole them he mentioned pill i have i said you mean that prescription i had and you stole from me he quickly try to change that subject he is crazy these were very serious allegation and threat i told him that last time i checked having a legitimate script in my name isn t going to label me a a druggie this is really aggravating because i have always worked full time and i am full custodial parent i live and breath taking care of my child all while he had leeched off me and stolen from me got fired time and time again from job loosing our medical putting extreme distress on me for year i dealt with his chaos and verbal abuse for way to long he is a vile monster also he had crashed his suv that he took from me in the divorce leaving me without a car i had to get another one he ha crashed it significantly twice since july the real kicker here is he is high everyday smoke weed he drink and he take a plethora of sleeping med antidepressant and benzos so if anyone could identify a a druggie it would be him not me i am very responsible had my same job for 6 year also he ha fulfilled not even 1 4 of this standard schedule i am the one that care for the child when he call in and miss all these set time then he actually can think he can make these threat i am going to take you down we are going to court all this stuff and when i said so you don t want me to care for chase full time anymore he said what no i never said that i mean straight crazy i have to get this lunatic away from u i think the le visitation the better this is why i have been so agreeable with all this calling in i hate that he is crazy i hate that me and my child have to deal with him i have documented everything i have the standard schedule we agree to in the divorce decree i have every single late pick up miss call in early drop off everything documented to the day with text back up with a plethora of lie and excuse which i also have documented this guy he want to take me down but then again doesn t want me to lose full custody i work with him but he won t work with me so i say ok forget my request then he can t do friday night anyways any one see how insane this dude is sorry for the novel i just thought thing would be over that i wa free from his abuse and now this when do i stop being so nice and really put the law in full force i mean from what i have read with him missing a much a he ha and asking the judge and me to sign off on a special overnight request to then not full fill it once then all the text and back up i have all while i have crossed every t and dotted every i i could most likely get him with contempt and could i get him down to only supervised visit he doesn t do what he ha now so i need to reduce it and get his abusive monster in check when do i just let him have it or it is much harder than this i have many concern when my child is in his care too my child told me dad slept in i asked more question turn out ex wouldn t wake up till 11am my chick sat there next to him playing

dating profile i ve noticed a trend in male dating profile and of course this isn t all men but quite too many i will see bios that say thing like my ex girlfriend ruined me just looking for something real i will also see i don t want a girl with a lot of baggage and ex boyfriend issue it made me think of tv and movie trope where a woman try to help the man move past his mental struggle whereas woman who are shown to be struggling men strictly avoid and sometimes mock those woman ha anyone else realized this or am i just on too many dating site because i m a girl with mental struggle,1
how to do i break up my 4 year relationship without hurting my girlfriend help please i feel horrible for feeling this way but the truth is that i don t love her anymore the main reason i feel this way is because of the way she treated me and the thing she did to me in the past during our 4 year relationship i suffered physical abuse from her only like 5 time but it happened physical abuse like punching scratching or hitting me in the face with a bos of cereal it s been a while since she s done it but she threatened to hit me or get me fired from my job a couple of week ago which show me that she hasn t changed she tried to get me fired from my job a couple of time in the past by sending message to my boss saying i m a thieve and other thing there is also no respect in the relationship either she talk to me like i m a piece of shit recently she been so sweet and nice to me and say she love me which make me feel bad for feeling the way i do she wa the love of my life but her behavior is what caused this whole situation it got to the point where i had to hide my document and important belonging from her out of fear she cut my clothes and broke a couple of my thing before because she wa angry she is very controling and want me to do what she want and threatened to break up with me or do something else if i didn t do what she want again she hasn t done it in a couple of month but still one part of me want to stay with her because i don t want her to suffer but my other is telling me to let her go i don t feel the sexual desire i once felt for her and i don t feel like i miss her when i m at work or away for a couple of day which i didn t understood at first when we moved in together i wasn t too sure about u living together due to her behavior she is basically my enemy when she get mad and that s the reason i don t trust her i spoke to her and begged her to change but nothing i been trying for 4 year with no luck she noticed im different now and even ask me if i still love her and i say yes because i don t want to make her suffer i feel bad for lying and feeling this way and don t want to make her suffer but it s been a toxic relationship what should i do,1

my wife 27f of 7 year and i 32m are fighting about gym time and resentment is rearing it ugly head i joined a new gym in april of this year and it ha proven to be one of the best decision i have made recently i have more energy i am happier and i have lost over 50 lb i work full time and my wife work part time we have a couple child 3 and 11 month my wife wa so supportive the first couple month but then she began to be discouraged because she felt insecure about her own weight and felt she couldn t commit time because we have a baby at home she joined a gym with child care so she could take the baby and i committed to taking our 3 year old with me she went to her gym twice during the 90 day membership and i have continued to take our son with me now however she is showing a lot of resentment because she feel i spend an unfair amount of time at the gym i go to the gym 3 day a week in the evening and i am gone from the house for an hour and a half occasionally 2 hour in the last 7 month i have gone to the gym 4 day in a week maybe 3 time so i can say it definitely 3 day a week almost always a little more info i leave our house fairly early in the morning i try to leave the house at 6 30am and i am home usually everyday by 5 00pm when i am not at the gym i am fully involved with my family i bathe both our kid every night and put our 3 year old down every night without fail i am with my wife and child every weekend and i am home almost 365 day a year sunday are a day we commit entirely to family a you can probably tell i am becoming resentful a well and i do not want resentment in our relationship she ha asked for compromise and for her compromise come in the form of me going to an early class which interferes with my ability to leave for work on time the gym doesn t have shower so i have to return home and shower and get ready which put me about 30 45 minute behind my normal schedule i have offered to go with her to the gym and watch both kid while she work out and then she can leave with the baby while i work out but she doesn t like our whole family being at the gym for 2 3 hour 3 day a week today i realized that the early class she want me to attend actually fit into her schedule perfectly because i could stay with the kid at home and get ready for work and a she walk in from the gym on her morning she work out i would leave for work right at my 6 30am goal she became angry with me for bringing the idea to the table because she doesn t want to do the early class when she expressed this anger and told me she wa feeling resentful i sat down with her to share with her how important our family is to me i have turned down job opportunity due to travel requirement and i decline lot of social opportunity because my absence upset her especially considering we have two young child i spend every day with my family and feel like i am not spending an excess amount of time at the gym but she insists i am is this the case i want to find a solution that we both think is fair but i keep feeling like she won t be happy until i am doing the early morning class which i can t do due to my work schedule tl dr wife is beginning to resent the time i spend at the gym i disagree and it is causing resentment from me a well struggling to find a solution,0

insane foreign stalker ex please help i thought i wa done posting on here forever i m not i have no idea what to do long story short i wa with someone i met while studying abroad for about 9 month he wa emotionally abusive and manipulative and i broke up with him four month ago he obsessively found way to reach out to me including making new facebook and instagram account contacting my friend and sending me a letter if you want more detail check my post history after the letter i contacted police and they put the incident on file but said there wasn t much else they could do since my state s law don t consider cyber harassment a a punishable offense the only thing they said wa to let them know if he sent me another letter the last i heard from him wa in august i thought he gave up after the letter well today happened i m a 21 year old college student and out of the blue i get a message from this guy from my school i barely know saying that someone tried to contact me through him in a really strange way he also gave me a name it wa my ex i messaged him back and he called me and explained what happened and sent me screenshots he said he made an account on this language exchange app called hello talk and he ended up talking to him seemingly randomly when my ex found out he went to my school he asked if he knew me and he said yes he then asked a bunch of weird question such a if he d seen me at a party he also said weird stuff like my name told me that she had a bunch of conquest at party did you happen to be one of them the dude wa confused and wa like yeah well i ve seen her at party coincidentally he and i had kissed once at a party like 3 year ago but that wa such a long time ago my ex kept pressing him to answer the question and the dude finally said yes we d hooked up once but we d only kissed or whatever my ex go join the club he started getting really mean and slut shame y saying stuff like yo it s so crazy to run into someone who s also done stuff with her actually maybe not since from what i ve heard that shouldn t be too rare the dude tried to defend me and wa like yeah well it might just be a coincidence and my ex go well she told me she had a lot of conquest so i think not he also kept pressing him about stuff like if i had a bad reputation or if his girlfriend knew me or wa friend with me and what she had to say about me he then said to tell his girlfriend to tell me he said hi and then said he hoped i would say something to him since it wa such a coincidence the guy tried to defend me again and said like oh well it s really not that uncommon it s college a lot of people hook up and stuff but yeah thats essentially how the conversation went anyway emotionally i find this frustrating because my ex knew i did kinda sleep around a bit but i told him it s because i d gotten out of an abusive relationship and i tried to like avoid the pain by doing that i wouldn t say i slept with a lot of people but it wa a few i know my ex hated hearing about it and he had this whole idea in his head that i wa gonna sleep around while with him one of my closest friend wa a guy and he wa so jealous of him he also wa convinced i d hook up with this random dude we met through one of my friend at this party i wa going to without him he wa just obsessed with this idea that i ve slept with some other dude before and even though i explained that it truly came from a place of hurt he still us it a a weapon against me and he s now using it to try and drag my name through the mud to complete stranger the guy said he didn t believe him and could tell he wa crazy but still but from a logical standpoint this is scary this kind of go along the line of the letter i received from him which also scared me bc i d never given him my address this app ha an option where you can search for people based on town or city so i m positive what he did wa look up my town and town near it to see if he could find me or someone who knew me and he succeeded in doing that additionally this wasn t just a gossip shit talking session the fact that he expressed twice an interest in reaching out to me show that he s still trying to get a hold of me he told the guy to get his girlfriend to tell me i said hi and then he said he hoped i d reach out to him my ex doesn t want to learn english his english is shit to be honest he just wanted to see if he could find another way to reach me since i ve blocked him everywhere else i m honestly scared i don t know if he s reached out to anyone else and i don t know if he s trying to find other way to get to me i m going back to his country in a few month and it s very unlikely he ll know i m there but it still scare me i don t want him to keep bothering me i don t want him to keep involving other people i know in this who don t deserve at all to be involved in this i want him to stop i don t think he ll hurt me and i don t think he pose a threat to my physical well being or my life but i want him to stop i probably won t be able to get a restraining order but would maybe a cease and desist letter work instead doe anyone know how those work internationally is there anything else i can do i just want him to go away,1
i 23m hit my girlfriend 22f really hard in the groin 100 by accident i ll explain and she s still in a lot of pain two day later lady i know it hurt to get hit there but doe it really hurt that much and she s still not talking to me what can i do to save our relationship first quick background and context my girlfriend and i live together and the two of u both uga grad and big fan were watching the georgia south carolina football game on tv in the living room of our apartment also important we have a super soft and resilient couch the kind that s so feathery you can just fall into it and need a forklift to get you out i brought it from my childhood house and let s just say it s taken a lot of bullet over the year i ve thrown thing at and punched it both in moment of joy and fury and my brother and i used to play slam each other onto it so it s pretty durable and battle tested to say the least it s basically become a therapy toy for me to unleash all my anger out on anyway the game went to double overtime and georgia s reliable kicker blew a game tying field goal to give south carolina a huge upset win in a fit of anger i just picked up a baseball that wa lying on the ground and fired it at the empty part of the therapy couch a hard a i could remember thing just sink into this couch so i figured it would be absorbed by the couch back and just fall harmlessly onto the couch seat however in her own fit of anger my girlfriend who wa seated on the other side of the couch leaped to her foot and right into the line of fire and the speeding ball just nailed her square in the clit complete accident freak thing got her right in the vag with an 80 mph fastball now i m not a total idiot i know there s a bone there and i know that a speeding baseball is going to hurt regardless of where it hit you so it completely make sense that she would be hurt by it especially with how hard i threw it but she immediately collapsed screaming in pain sobbing and writhing on the floor which stunned me i guess i just expected it to be more of an ow fuck dude be careful that hurt kind of pain where she d be ok within a minute or so instead she not only reacted worse than any guy i ve ever seen get hit in the groin but far worse i mean i ve seen guy fall over and moan for like 90 second or so but then stand up and walk it off and ultimately be ok by contrast my girlfriend wa cry and rolling from side to side for at least five solid minute before she could reset herself and then spent the next four hour on the couch with an ice bag between her leg which frightened me because she s a pretty tough girl who never complains about anything the whole rest of the day she wa whimpering and moaning saying i d hit her right in the spot which she angrily confirmed meant her clitoris and that she couldn t believe i d done that which make two of u a i obviously did not intend to hit her with the baseball period much le in the clit so i guess i have two question one lady what doe it feel like exactly to be hit in the clitoris like how painful is it from 1 10 could long term damage ensue to reiterate i m not merely asking if it hurt because i know it doe i realize there are a lot of nerve there i m asking if it s comparable to a guy getting hit in his stuff or if it s even worse because again i ve never seen a guy react that badly and now i m worried that i might have done some serious damage and two um what the hell do i do now of course i apologized profusely and repeatedly a obviously it wa an accident and i legitimately feel terrible we ve been dating for almost two year and living together for four month she s my best friend and i really don t want to lose her but i m worried she doesn t trust me anymore she s gone to great length to ignore me these past few day and she s usually very affable and can talk your ear off i realize that i hurt her in an embarrassing place to get hurt but she ha to know it wa a freak accident right what can i do to ensure i don t lose her because of this tdlr i hit my girlfriend extremely hard in the crotch 100 by accident i know it hurt for girl to get hit there i m not asking that but lady i m curious a to how much it hurt could i have caused real damage and of course i feel awful how do i regain her trust after doing that,0

crisis of conscience regarding abuser s homelessness i just got out of an abusive relationship in which my abuser stole from me gaslighted me and verbally abused me screaming and cussing he wa staying with me because his parent threw him out now he is sleeping in his car the other night he called me cry threatening suicide and begging me to take him back i told him i couldn t take him back but i would be willing to drive him to the hospital if he is suicidal he wouldn t go because he doesn t want to have his gun taken away for that same reason he refuse to go to a homeless shelter i talked to his parent they said that he ha been stealing from them and lying to them for year that s why they threw him out in the first place they suggested i block his number so i did they also told me that he came back to them after i turned him away and asked for help and they were willing to help him so long a he left me alone i thought that wa a solution to the problem today i found out that they are not willing to take him back into their house instead they are going to suggest the same thing i ve already suggested and he ha already said no to it is freezing out at night and we are about to have a big snowfall even after all he s done i don t want to see him freeze to death i don t know what else to do though i feel like if he s not willing to take the suggestion that i and his parent have given him my hand are tied but another part of me feel ethically obligated to at least let him sleep on the couch so he doesn t freeze to death my concern is that if i do that my own safety will be at risk the day that i threw him out his behavior wa very frightening to the point that i felt the need to have my lock changed what should i do,1

my girlfriend 23f and i 25m are about to be together for 1 year and we haven t had sex due to issue she ha with it i assured her i can be patient but i m starting to doubt my own word good night everyone i originally posted this on another subreddit but did not receive any significant response so i figured i d try my chance here will adapt it to this sub s rule the best i can but if something is amiss i ll be happy to modify it first apology for any possible grammatical error english is not my native language and thus i may write too much in fear of not being precise enough secondly i wasn t sure this would require an nsfw tag but i put it nonetheless to be cautious amp x200b on to the situation at hand wall of text below a the tittle suggests my girlfriend and i who i very very much love with all my heart have not had sex yet in the entirety of our relationship to contextualize we are not each other s first partner nor we are virgin however we both had individually just gotten out of abusive relationship ourselves and agreed we should communicate and be careful with each others sensibility to a higher degree than normal this didn t really became an issue because fortunately we hit off incredibly well we share enough interest and world view to live peacefully but with enough difference to not be carbon copy of each others a an example we both love video game with many genre overlap yet i like isometric rpgs while she can t stand them and she also playes mobile game which i despise however we can enjoy them individually and not drag the other to do something he she dislike this is basically how much of our relationship work the main issue we or rather i am facing is the act of having any form of sexual relationship when we started dating she confessed she never had positive experience regarding sex with her ex both men and woman she is bi i m straight and always had difficulty saying no to people so she ended up simply giving herself up for 30min to an hour in hope of making her partner satisfied her word when she told me that i made sure to let her know i d never ask for something that would make her uncomfortable and asked how she d like to proceed with that basically she said she d talk with both her therapist and a sexologist to see how best to work her apparent issue with the act itself because a i understand it s not that she lack desire i initially thought she could be asexual but she made clear that wasn t the case but that the act wa always uncomfortable and she wanted to progress slowly but steadly she also asked for my help in this by making sure i would not her fall into a comfort zone and never work this through i love this woman from the bottom of my heart she is the very first person who made me daydream about a future together to be there for the good the bad the boring all of it she wasn t even my type physically a she is very petite and i always had a preference for more curvacious woman yet she stir a fire inside that fuel a desire i ve never experienced before and more i actually believe she feel the same in literally all aspect except the sexual one i admit i don t bring this up often because i m afraid she might feel bothered or even direspected by this but the truth is this thing is special to me very special my whole adolescent life i wa mocked by friend for not acting on my hormonoes since from that age i felt like this wa something very intimate and very personal i had casual sex once and while it wasn t exactly bad it wa both nothing special and certainly not worth all the social setup i know this speaks volume about a few issue of my own and i would never intentionally project them on anyone especially not on her we did talk about this a few month ago where i told her how this wa very special for me and how the lack of it wa bothering me a lot but at that time i also told her what wa hurting the most wa thinking how she apparently didn t care about that at all and how unimportant this whole thing seemed to her obviously i made sure to let her know a i quite literally always do when we talk about thing like this that she is not to blame for anything she feel or doesn t feel sometimes different people react differently to different thing and i wa frustrated with my own expectation not being met not with her and that she shouldn t feel obliged to do anything only if she wanted out of her volition she confessed it wa not that at all that she actually sometimes feel bad for putting me trough this that she wished this wasn t a difficult a it is she even confessed that one time when i wa getting out of the shower and began talking with her she wa looking at me in the eye not because she wa uninterested in what she wa seeing but rather she wa so interested she thought it would be rude to look where she wanted so she did her best to lock on my face she also disclosed a situation where she fantasized for an entire car trip after reading some erotica before i picked her up honestly this conversation did make me feel a lot better at the time however the most progress we had since then wa when she wa over at my place for an afternoon and i gave her a back rub which she later confessed actually aroused her this wa in november if i remember correctly and the last time we did something remotely intimate i go to her place fairly often we chill at the couch while watching top 10 on youtube or stuff like that but we cannot have privacy over there a her parent would understendably be uncomfortable i honestly don t really know what to do each day that pass i feel like i m inadequate that i m le of a man for not being able to neither help her with this more efficiently nor be at peace with what i have she is obviously not perfect but i feel like she is perfect for me and i feel awful thinking i can t be the same for her i don t know what do to tl dr sex is important for me and the lack of it in my relationship is starting to seriously bother me girlfriend however ha issue of her own regarding the act thing are moving too slowly for me,0

me 32f with my cousin 20m repaying my husband s 33m kindness with betrayal throwaway because my asshole cousin is a redditor a well i should note that i often pitch in and help at my husband s small company if needed and sometimes study in his office hence my involvement my husband ha been a mentor to my cousin for a number of year it started when cousin became interested in music husband is an accomplished musician and the two of them bonded over the subject when cousin graduated high school and decided to study music my husband gifted him an expensive musical instrument that his father had gifted him a a teenager it wa very touching and tear were shed among the family cousin ha a natural proclivity for the industry my husband work in too my husband arranged for his company to hire cousin casually while he studied cousin life in another state but husband arranged for him to work remotely with flexible hour at graduate level pay cousin had several complaint made about his brashness arrogance and rudeness he ha self diagnosed with autism so his rudeness wa reprimanded but overall he got away with it the thing that annoyed me is that while he is acknowledged to be very good at his job he often wrongly assumed seniority over his coworkers all of whom are graduate in the field which he ha never studied he travelled down for a month in june to spend time in the office and one afternoon i took him shopping for video game and gave him some cash to help with transport since he wa without a car our shopping trip ended poorly though with no video game purchased when he called me white trash because i mentioned my love of handbag he abruptly resigned by email two week ago his wording wa a copy paste of the briefest resignation letter template on google he ignored all my husband s call to find out what wa going on i had a strange feeling and asked my husband to cut off his access from the system and see what he d been up to turn out he d been savagely disrespectful about my husband to other employee in hangout made borderline racist comment about another employee s accent and generally awful comment about other employee competence when we cut his access off he tried and failed to hack into the owner s login and another employee s we discovered he solicited an ex employee for contract work in july ha been double jobbing for that person who we were already aware wa trying to go into direct competition with my husband s company data security is obviously a concern finally he answered the phone and off handedly apologised to my husband for not picking his up his call he lied and said he hadn t spoken to the ex employee for over a year my husband is refusing to take legal action saying it would be awful to drag a wee boy down to our state to face court and that he can t stomach doing that to a family member he ll swear at him on the phone but he won t sue the little bastard the company owner is shocked and hurt he had been a dear friend for year and a mentor to my husband but my sense is that there is a distance growing between them since this incident when i visit the office i can feel tension that wasn t there before i am expecting to see cousin s branch of the family at christmas and frankly i don t think i ll be able to keep my temper the little creep ha hurt u and possibly damaged my husband s career i need advice on what to do given that my husband is so infuriatingly intractable about legal action and i am sick with rage should i call cousin s parent send a vitriolic email to cousin i am very close to cousin s older brother and we are having dinner tomorrow night but so far i have not wanted to involve him am i wrong this hurt and anger is really eating me up tl dr we learned the hard way never to do business with family and now i m wondering how to remain family with someone i absolutely hate,0

coming to term with the fact that my most recent relationship wa abusive i wa in a relationship for about a year with this person and although deep down i knew that something wa wrong i ve only just now begun to come to term with it unlike my first abusive relationship which wa clearly abusive in all way physically sexually emotionally mentally this one wasn t a black and white although there wa no physical abuse there wa double the amount of emotional and mental abuse which i feel like get overlooked a lot in general the person i dated wa manipulative in many way incredibly selfish and hateful towards me and my identity they were insecure about their life and took it out on me making me feel guilty for simple thing such a having a job and a social life they isolated me from my friend by convincing me that my friend weren t good enough for me and even attempted to do the same with certain family member they even spoke to several underaged child a a fully grown adult in questionable way i could go on but i m not here to recount the relationship very few people know the gritty detail about the relationship i want to talk to my mom about it a she still think highly of them and will occasionally speak to their mom a well just today she asked me how they were doing they have recently gotten a job and my mom wa expressing her excitement for them it really hurt me but i m afraid to tell her the truth because i ve already been in one abusive relationship before this one and i feel like i ve almost let her down during the end of the first relationship i wa an absolute wreck and she had to deal with it all thankfully that s not the case now but i m afraid of burdening her with the knowledge that this person whom she think highly of is actually not a good person i m also mad at myself for letting it happen again i saw the red flag from the moment we met and chose to ignore them i don t want to blame myself but i can t help but do it sometimes any guidance tip or support would be greatly appreciated lt 3,1

i m starting to think my 30f husband 33m of 5 year is not going to get me a christmas gift is it wrong to be this upset about it he s always been terrible at gift giving time and it s really starting to make me feel terrible and the idea that i should have to say something at all is just making me feel even worse because he know this bother me and it ha been a constant issue in our relationship birthday valentine s day our anniversary they all pas with barely any effort from him at all and the fact that it keep happening is just compounding the issue i m not even a huge gift person i m not asking for a lot i would be happy with a book or something small like that the whole point is to show someone you are thinking of them and i just don t feel like he think of me at all some example for valentine s day we agreed to go on a dinner date and it literally never happened on my birthday he forgot to get me a card or anything so he cooked me dinner instead which i appreciated but honestly it wa the bare minimum and it felt like an afterthought there wa no effort to even like go shopping for ingredient just no thought put into it at all on our anniversary i had to basically force him to come for a hike with me because without that we would have done nothing at all and that wa a big one for me too 5 year married and he didn t even bother with a card and the last two christmas i literally told him exactly what to buy me because i wa getting so upset about the idea that i d wake up christmas morning to an apology because he just didn t have time to get me anything but this year i didn t and he still hasn t even gone shopping i bought his gift week ago i don t even know what to do or say anymore i wa in tear this morning just thinking about how much of a let down it is going to be again to have to wake up christmas morning give him his gift and then have to put a smile on and say it s ok that s not what the holiday is about anyway and i m just happy to spend time with you when he sheepishly say he didn t do anything for me i feel stupid for being so hurt by this but honestly it just make me feel like an afterthought in his life on top of that christmas is a big deal for me in general we re not religious at all but i had all of these idea when we got married and bought our house that we d be able to start our own christmas tradition and it would be like we were officially our own little family but i end up having to take the lead on everything we haven t even set up a tree this year and it s kind of tearing me apart am i being awful or is this justified because honestly i can t tell anymore i didn t think i wa a materialistic person but if i wasn t why would the idea of not getting anything for christmas hurt me so much i m scared we re going to get in a big fight soon because every day thinking about it is just hurting my feeling more and more like if i try to talk to him about this again i m afraid i m just going to explode and then if he doe take me seriously and put a little bit of effort in this christmas i feel like it s just going to tarnish it anyway like he wouldn t have just done it himself and that s kind of the whole point of the thing i m at a loss here and not sure how to deal with it thought tl dr husband suck at gift giving and doesn t put any effort in on special occasion pretty sure this christmas will be the same and i won t have a single gift to open on the day and i m worried about the fight that is coming if that happens because honestly after 5 year of this i m getting really tired and feeling absolutely horrible i m not sure what to do,0

my 31 f friend and coworker 42 f asked to leave her son 15 m at my house for 12 hour tomorrow so she doesn t have to leave happy hour early to pick him up is that a normal thing for parent to do i like my friend but i m a bit weirded out by her request i don t have kid so maybe this is just a normal kid thing the background is that tomorrow is her last work day at our job and she scheduled a goodbye happy hour right after work i guess she and her son have had concert ticket for tomorrow night for awhile she life about 30 45 minute from work during rush hour and i live 5 minute away she said her son doesn t want to take the bus to our work place before the concert because he would have to transfer and it would be a pain and she want to stay at the happy hour a long a possible so she doesn t want to drive home after and pick him up so asked if he could stay here when i asked her how long she said she would drop him off at 7 am and pick him up whenever happy hour wa over probably around 7 pm except our work happy hour never end that early so it won t be 7 pm if she really ha a concert that night i expect she will end up leaving a late a possible but trying to make the concert on time i said yes because i wa taken by surprise over the phone and also because there s also probably no way i would tell someone that i wont let their kid shelter in my house however i feel weird about it i told her both me and my husband would only be home part of the day because of work and she said it wa fine he entertained himself and to just put him in front of the tv is it really normal to drop your kid off at an unknown house with someone they have never met for 12 hour where they will be alone for like 6 hour and awkwardly interacting with u for the other 5 i feel like instead she should just 1 leave her happy hour early enough to get him at home or 2 get an uber to drop him off at 7 before their concert or 3 i dunno reschedule her goodbye happy hour for a date that she isn t going to a concert with her 15 year old son right after like why have tomorrow be her last day of work and party if she s had these concert ticket i know it s probably too late and either way it s not this kid fault so of course he can stay i would probably let a homeless 15 year old kid off the street come in for food and warmth or whatever but i feel weird about this situation i d really like other opinion tl dr should a 15 year old kid be dropped at my house for 12 hour because his mom doesn t want to leave happy hour early,0

my 32m identical twin s fiance 29f is starting to seem like the worst person for him in the long run how do i break this to him i had to repost this because apparently accurately describing my future sil qualifies a bad language so here we go again my future sil seems like bad news and there are red flag everywhere i however only know the part i have witnessed first hand or have heard from my brother second hand therefore i turn to reddit for my ranting and for any advice should someone have some that ha been a similar situation if anyone who read this ha an identical twin my brother and i are close closer than best friend i would put my wife 1a and my twin 1b in term of people i care about i m using my alt account because my brother us reddit though if he s cruising the relationship subreddit he ll figure this out quickly this is going to be a long post we ll call my brother mark and his fiance anna mark and anna started dating in january 2016 mark and anna lived in the city for a while and now the suburb last year anna moved away for grad school a few hour away on a 2 year program mark drive to go see anna at least twice a month anna come up to our city when she ha break from school mark proposed in late june 2019 mark did not talk to me nor my parent nor any of his friend before speaking to anna s father about proposing he told me afterwards i didn t talk to anyone because i know they would have said it wasn t a good idea so that show that mark at least is aware that our immediate family ha reservation about this i m also worried that mark is doing this only because they have been together for 3 year sunk cost fallacy and i have already gotten engaged and married mark ha told me that she make him happy and that he love her anna ha a nice dog that mark see s a his own she ha gotten him to be a better person by eating healthier and stuff one could make the argument however that mark is marrying anna because of the dog i m not kidding anna is not from our city but from one a few hour away mark and i work in a family business 10 year now for both of u that will be transitioning soon hopefully to our leadership this entire time anna ha been pressuring mark to move away from our hometown and leave the company that ha been in our family for almost 90 year we would be 4th generation owner this ha been going on for 3 year she try to pressure him into leaving by saying that our city major american city is a dump and the people are terrible she keep threatening to leave him if he doesn t move away saying he could work somewhere else and that our company doe not matter i don t know how to put this she seems like a mean spirited person she s super critical and rude to server at restaurant we ve been too over a smudge on a wine glass another time mark and i had our birthday last year at our favorite local brewery and had a ton of food left over after everyone wa leaving just sitting there covering this long table these 2 random girl we didn t know had come over a couple time to grab a cookie or whatever and after like the 3rd or 4th time i caught them in the act and just stated plainly and amusedly you can just ask if you d like some not angry just amused and annoyed that people can t be adult these girl then went back to they spot across the bar this is not something to lose your mind over anna then walked over to them took out her phone and got in their face she asked them with her phone recording in there face why do you think it ok to steal and other stuff talking down to these girl like they were toddler about how stealing is bad and stuff it wa embarrassing and cringey this turned into shoving insult and accusation between both party my wife ended up apologizing to the brewery manager to smooth everything over i am not going to sugar coat this anna and my wife do not get along it s to the point where at family function they both coexist but do not talk they both think the other one hate them and there s some just plain old stubborn animosity i m not going to go into all the minor detail but let just say that i don t think this is changing any time soon this next part is basically my last straw my wife and i got married 3 month ago on labor day weekend mark wa my best man and anna wa attending the wedding this entire wedding weekend she wa terrible from belittling mark about the seating arrangement because she couldn t sit with him we had a head table that she had to drive up from grad school for our rehearsal dinner anna reamed mark out about how picture took too long in front of my wife s extended family she had a scowl on her face the whole time so when we got our picture back from the wedding from the photographer you can see anna glaring while my wife is having her father daughter dance but the last straw anna did not stand up when my wife came down the aisle she stayed glued to her seat facing forward this a person that hike routinely and ha no ailment whatsoever i m not kidding when my mom s friend who didn t know anna pointed this out to my mom it s an embarrassment to mark my family and an insult to my wife at this point i m done with trying to be friend with anna for the sake of my brother last night while we were playing ps4 online mark told me he had to take a call from anna mark left his headset plugged in with the microphone on accident i heard her threaten to leave him again and some other stuff today i talked to mark and i could see the toll this ha been taking on him mark and anna have set their wedding date taken engagement picture booked vendor etc i know my parent especially my mom don t see anna a someone good for mark my wife called this back in 2016 and look like nostradamus i want my brother to understand that he doesn t need to accept being treated this way do i just outright tell him our relationship is strange because even though we are extremely close mark ha a tendency to take whatever i tell him about something that s hard to hear and think i mean the exact opposite if anyone ha ever dealt with a close friend or sibling that is settling for someone like this let me know tl dr my future sil ha a bunch of red flag and seems to be bad news for my twin brother besides just telling him to end it outright before the wedding what is it that i can do,0

help 95 wonderful 5 absolutely terrifying completely new here a bit desperate super anxious about sharing private detail i ll just leave bullet point wanting perspective really not wanting a knee jerk leave her response the 95 good honestly too many perfect thing to list nuanced shared cultural interest writing cooking our particular variety of travel endless conversation even after a decade most day our relationship would score the best thing in our life and despite challenge i think we re quite lucky to begin with so that s saying a lot she ha helped me grow more and feel more full than anyone i ve ever met and i have come to learn that i have indeed been blessed with a surplus of already wonderful people in my life so again that s saying a lot she s so often incredibly loving tender just soul nourishing sweet infinitely patient a coach a true partner before reading the bad internalize how good the good is and how often it is the 5 scary which i have to itemize a specific event that take place usually month apart but over 10 year they add up whenever it happens she s consumed by it and completely blind to her action she s always equally remorseful and terrified herself afterwards she hate herself for these thing at one point or another she ha done the following thrown a chair at me smashed dish slapped me choked me wrapping her hand firmly around me neck in a threatening way than anything close to homicidal cheated on me multiple time 4 time making out once slept with someone always extremely drunken one off occasion and always confessed immediately and wa filled with shame and self hatred dropped her engagement ring on the street a number of time though not anymore she also used to nag about how small her diamond is to be fair it is legitimately small and i could have afforded a bigger one if i had planned more and actually listened to her we re also from very different class and we just had different expectation that we didn t talk through enough regularly verbally abusive if i do stupid thing like leave thing in the wrong place at home or forget my wallet or something i m quite absent minded and she s ocd which is a horrible combination thing like you re so fucking stupid you re a grown man and can t do thing that a monkey could master you re a waste of space how can you keep dragging me down at every fucking turn in my life you can t even buy fucking grocery correctly literally you don t bring anything to this relationship what do you bring what can you tell me one thing you even apologize stupid why are you stammering fucking talk are you flinching you re fucking pathetic honestly i don t have any reason to be in this fucking relationship i have to drag everything myself for example 30 minute later she apologizes and we talk through it she s admitted recently through tear that she realizes i m sometimes afraid of her and say she doesn t want to become her father and is terrified that she s breaking me the same level of terror convert to the deepest remorse the source of that rage raped at least twice that i know of multiple abortion violent father threw a tv at her wa once golfing inside the house used a belt would remove all the bedroom door because privacy wa a privilege she s bi and when her parent started suspecting they suggested that they would disown a gay child she s still never fully been out with them but is with friend sent to a mental institution for a few month at 14 or 15 for lying about doing drug even though she wasn t then though started to after getting accused of it sent to boarding school when she wa 15 fled with her mom to the continental u she s from a caribbean island to escape violence at home wa left at 17 alone in the continental u after her mom decided to go back home finished high school living alone in an apartment that her parent paid for remotely but had to work to have enough money for grocery ended up homeless for several month staying with some drifter mostly sleeping in car family stopped talking to her except her grandmother who finally went to rescue her herself when her parent refused to at least 2 suicide attempt that i know of parent are now in the middle of an ugly divorce from me i have completely mismanaged finance in the past and lost considerable money then i lied about it 50 because i wa cowardly and selfish 50 because i wa afraid of her reaction when i made small mistake that then snowballed when we first started dating we were both in the middle of ending relationship i wasn t honest with her about some important thing early on that i regret deeply and introduced a trust problem early i grew up in a hoarder house and have had to learn how to be a regular tidy person and organize thing i am a horrible listener i feel like i m trying but it is clearly not cutting it i make so many stupid mistake what she doe with that rage 95 of the time focus it into crystal clear focus cogent and cautious self analysis brilliant creative expression truly magnanimous support in all her relationship from family to friend to coworkers to me her partner managed to get through college and into a competitive career you would never guess any of this if you met her u best friend for over a decade met in college married for almost 4 year most of it happy deep enriching bi cultural relationship wealthy conservative urban carribbean ocd v lower middle class liberal rural american midwest messy hoarder living abroad together for 10 year year both work in highly competitive creative industry consequence if a situation escalates even just verbally i devolve into barely being able to formulate sentence and my job sometimes involves given persuasive speech to a many a 200 people so normally articulation is far from a problem for me i flinch my heart race i get tunnel vision i breathe quickly i just want to disappear i m afraid to tell her bad news even though 95 of the time she take everything in stride and is super rational and supportive we can t decide about kid even though i always wanted them until now because i m afraid of what the home would be i fantasize about having an affair with some super chill girl but i only a a fleeting escape to blow off steam i ve had opportunity but never acted i cannot fathom leaving nor can she too much of it is too good and we are regularly the relationship that all our friend and family look up to because we re role model 95 of the time but nobody know of the 5,1

my fiance 24 m asked me 25 f if we could possibly re open our relationship my fiance and i have been together for a little over three year now we ve been engaged for nearly two year we had an open relationship before we got engaged for a couple of reason one wa simply because we wanted to be with other people and the other wa because i knew i wanted to marry him eventually and he wa a virgin when we had met and would want to be with more than just one person in his life we had decided long before we got engaged that if we were to that we would close the relationship when we finally did get engaged that s what we did and he hadn t been with anyone else besides me during that time i thought it wa because he didn t want to be turn out that s not why the other night he told me he had to tell me something that may upset me he said that for a while he had been thinking of having sex with other people that he wa jealous of the experience i have had and that part of the reason he never found anyone else during our previously open relationship wa lack of confidence he thought he couldn t attract anyone else and that he wa lucky he found me he ha since realized that may not be the case and he could probably find a few woman to be with and maybe finally find out if he is bisexual or not he said that he wanted me to decide if we should reopen the relationship have a couple of threesome or just leave it a is but he had to get it off of his chest he want to leave it up to me what we do if we do anything at all and he ll accept whatever i say we talked about it at length that night and have been talking about it since he ha asked me what my ground rule would be if we were to do this some of the ground rule i set were i get to decide if i like the person enough for him to meet her him i can shut it down at any time if we recognize or know the people it is a no go he ha to get regular std sti check he must wear protection at all time and start using protection with me again i can look through his phone if i start to feel uncomfortable and if i change my mind i can tell him and we won t do this anymore he also made sure to add that if we were to re open the relationship that it definitely would not be one way the only problem with that is i don t want to be with anyone else anymore which he is aware of he ha accepted any term i have i m worried for several reason which i ve made him aware of some of them being what if he want to be with someone else and leave me what if he find someone crazy and what it he find out i m not that great at sex and doesn t want to come back to my bed i have anxiety so there are more worry i have related to this issue i need advice i m not sure what to do i don t even know if i should reopen our relationship or leave it a is what if i decide i don t want to and he isn t a ok a he said he would be sorry if this isn t a well written a it should be i ve never been that good at writing or with grammar a i could be and with the added stress of the situation i m a little scattered tl dr my fiance asked to re open the relationship and i have no clue what to do i need advice,0

update i 32 m have faded from the group update to tl dr i successfully stopped spending time with my friend and while it is nice not to be stressed out over whether i m being messed with it suck to know for sure that you aren t missed i don t think there s any going back at this point and part of me lament it but i know it s what is best for everyone not much response to my previous post but here s a recap and update for posterity recap my main group of friend for the past several year play game together online for 4 hour nightly i started feeling gaslit by a new female member s perceived passive aggression culminating in a ruined vacation in march due to her omnipresence in group activity i found it difficult to avoid her and did not find any support with my closest friend for my feeling after several month of trying to actively avoid her while still spending time with other friend i found myself more frustrated than ever and decided to stop participating in group activity at all update in order to ensure i wasn t tempted to communicate with the group i immediately muted and hid all group chat i wa a member of and logged out of steam chat so i couldn t see what everyone else wa doing and quit our group d amp d game and most importantly stopped getting onto our voip chat that everyone us from 7pm every night of the week out of sight out of mind i told them all i wa starting a full time online college program to excuse my absence and i used the opportunity to learn some new non gaming skill and that kept me occupied for the first couple week i still enjoy and focus on them but i m also back to gaming a much a i ever did just alone now no one except my close friend ever try to reach out and even he is just sending me random meme not actually talking or anything i ve taken special effort to try and maintain contact with him but it s hard to get him talking through text 99 of the time i did convince him and a friend from another group to drive a few hour to visit over a weekend once a well my wife and i are still making the trip to boston next year for pax east which that whole group is attending but she and i will get separate accommodation from everyone else and i hope to avoid them completely since it caused so much anxiety last year i really really miss my good friend he moved to a new state 6 month ago after living with u for 2 1 2 year so i m used to a level of communication that we just don t have anymore i m having a hard time reading if he is annoyed or hurt by my insistence on doing this but he ha definitely pulled away himself which i wa worried about he is still spending every single night of the week online with these people so i can t expect to do anything with him alone or without involving the source of my stress so i don t think there s anything to be done about it i m 32 i have a wife and two kid so there s plenty to keep me occupied and i guess i can t claim to be lonely necessarily but i definitely don t feel good it s only been 4 month though so i guess it will become the new normal eventually,0
m26 my fiancé f25 cheated on me last night i am utterly lost i don t even know where to begin we ve been together for 7 year engaged for 1 she became a police officer in december 2018 and started the academy we ve always had a strong relationship one that i ve never doubted or felt like i didn t trust her we ve had our problem throughout the year but nothing we couldn t work through and nothing that majorly concerned me once the academy started she began to go out with friend from her class and many time she would stay out late 2 3am this made me very uncomfortable a i am not the type of person who frequents bar or enjoys staying out that late and i am a firm believer in the saying nothing good happens after 2am we had a near breakup towards the beginning of the academy a she felt our relationship had become stagnant and she felt a though her life had become so routine due to the demand of the academy she would often work 8 4 come home wash her police uniform iron it and shine her boot i would get home around 6 and cook dinner we eventually worked through it but the stress of police work only got worse after the academy fast forward to last night many officer went to a party thrown by the department and ended up hitting a bar afterward she called me and told me what wa going on and i asked her to do me a favor and just be home before 2am sure enough 1 45 roll around and she tell me she ha to drive home a very inebriated coworker to make a long story short her story didn t match up and she came home at 3am with no underwear messed up makeup and very wet pant i wa suspicious but didn t want to push the issue and we ended up having sex the next morning i wa dwelling on the inconsistency in the story and ended up confronting her she eventually admitted she fucked one of her coworkers in his car i wa legitimately in shock and couldn t believe what wa happening the kicker is i called her for an update and she rushed me off the phone right before she got into his car and fucked him so it s not like i wasn t on her mind i found this out at 3pm today and went to get drink with 2 close friend they offered for me to crash on their couch if i wanted to grab some stuff from home i came home and ended up talking to my fiancé and she told me she still want to work on thing and think we can come back from this and that she love me the whole nine yard so now i m laying down in bed writing this post very unsure of how to proceed this is the only relationship i ve ever been in and i genuinely don t want to lose her i cannot fathom that someone i love so much hurt me so badly and yet i just want everything to be okay i feel so betrayed embarrassed emasculated and many other thing where the fuck do i go from here tldr fiancé of 7 year cheated on me with a coworker then came home and fucked me and acted like everything wa okay in shock and unsure of what to do,0

i 26f think i m falling for this girl 27f and i m straight usually i take some thing like this to my friend but i m really confused and i don t want to open the gate of sexuality when i m not even sure i made a tinder account to make some new friend since i moved back to my hometown i know bumble ha a friend feature but with tinder it seems like people use it more i did put in my bio that i wa looking for friend i got a few match but most of them never messaged me back i did connect with this one girl we will call her ally for this ally is really gay and that s cool with me i told her i wasn t gay and she wa so nice and kind about it we have been talking everyday since we matched in late august we have hung out a handful of time but her job keep her occupied a lot so it hasn t been a much a we would both like i noticed she had been getting flirty with me and to be honest i have been with her but i sort of pumped the brake and reminded her that we were just friend to which she reassured me it wasn t until the other night that i had a oh fuck moment we were chillin and drinking wine at her apartment and she wa talking to me about something that happened at work and i don t know why but i really noticed her eye imagine a pair of golden marble they were so mesmerizing to me that moment i really looked into her eye and saw her soul i saw the beautiful person she wa not only on the outside but on the inside too she s so kind and funny how deep her dimple get when she laugh is probably the most adorable thing i ve ever seen after i went home i wa just thinking about her and i wanted to kiss her ally also told me that she have a date this week and part of me really doesn t want her to go but the other part of me know that i told her we were just friend to begin with and i can t and will not stop her from living her life it s deeper than an infatuation with her being an amazing person like i feel a though i would be so safe and comfortable with her if any other form of intimacy wa explored but in my heart i still know and feel that i only want to pursue a relationship like that with a man it s sorta tearing me apart tldr i have been friend with a gay girl for a little while now she is apart of my everyday life and even though i am straight i feel myself falling for her,0

those year although the last year wa so shit i m not even counting it we met when we were 16 he became my best friend and a year later got together when we realised we had feeling for each other we were two pea in a pod did everything together we were the power couple we were going to have a future together a friend of mine once even said the day you two break up i ll honestly stop believing in love flash forward 6 year into our relationship and we decide to move abroad it had it niggles but we stayed strong there were thing we began to fight about mainly him being too close to his family now i love my family but he would call his mom every single day no matter if we were in the middle of a date almost asleep out somewhere or just having u time his mum didn t deal well with her baby boy moving away and he felt he needed to support her i tried to understand this the best i could fast forward a year we get married but we continue to argue because of family by this point he call his parent 3 time a day and i m starting to feel a bit isolated because i have no proper friend group yet i struggle to socialise and i get home and the little time i have between work and going to bed is usually listening to him talk to his parent for an hour then get upset why i didn t join in he would call the shot when we went back home to visit we d usually do what he wanted and see who he wanted because he d get mad if i didn t agree our dad start working together and right before the wedding had an argument which he blamed me for even though i wasn t even in the country when it happened and i only found out about it 2 day later in hindsight that s when the emotional abuse started and my need to apologise for everything even for stuff i have no control over before we got married my anxiety had started to kick in either because of the stress of planning a wedding or our family fighting or whatever but it didn t go away and just got worse and worse but by then he wa acting so aggressively towards me i didn t feel i could talk to him about it he wouldn t notice my panic attack and there were a couple of time i passed out on the bathroom floor for over an hour from hyperventilating so much he wa gaming and didn t notice i began to feel so alone i didn t feel comfortable going out with certain friend because he didn t like them he criticised my eating choice my clothes my weight my attitude my posture even said once i pee too loudly when i d go in for a kiss he would ask if i deserved it and would state at me til i backed down i have never felt so alone in my life the only time i would get his attention is sometimes in the middle of the night he d be in the mood and it didn t really matter if i wa ready or not it wa going to happen he accused me of cheating on him even though i suspected he actually did chest on me he had me move out for a week so he could have a break and the evening i came back he just looked up and said hi like i had just gone out for some milk 20 min ago he would game constantly i would get home and he d be on his pc he only left to talk to his parent and to eat the dinner i d always have to cook i planned a weekend away for easter and he seemed like he wa there a a favour didn t smile the whole time even though i had chocolate waiting for him in the room and had load of fun stuff planned i tried to talk to him about my anxiety finally and it wa so hard when i wa done he acted like i wa crazy and needed to be in a straight jacket so i kept it to myself the panic attack got worse and i wa having one at least once a day i wa permanently tired but he criticised me for sleeping too much one day on my way to work i had a complete breakdown and that time he wa supportive i guess he understood i wasn t kidding he went on to be a bit nicer but eventually went back to his usual self when i quit my job he sent round an angry all staff email we worked in the same company and almost got himself fired the email wa sticking up for me tbf i quit because my bos wa giving me a hard time but he s often through it in my face like i almost got fired for you even though i never asked him to do such a thing in my new job i ended up working from 8am until late hour 9 10pm sometimes just so i didn t have to be at home i couldn t tell my mum about it because he would say i tell my mum everything nor could i tell friend because he would get mad at me for talking to people about our problem in april last year he moved out said he couldn t do this anymore and left my colleague thought he wa together with this girl since july even though we split up in october the girl i thought he wa cheating on me with turn out he planned holiday for the next year with her and her friend and didn t tell me about it while we were still together we tried for month but the more i spent away from him the happier i felt i felt guilty about it though we broke up in october he insisted we break up i still loved him and didn t want to last year and i ve never felt such relief in my life i remember dancing in my underwear with loud music on and singing i dated a bit i had never kissed someone else besides him so felt i needed to experience something someone else i got all the piercings i wanted to get but never did because he didn t approve all the tattoo i wanted and more i smoked i drank i went out all the thing i wa never able to do because he didn t approve i ve cut him out of my life completely after he kept coming back in to and every time he did i d go right back to square one of feeling absolutely shit about myself like he had some mgic trick and knew exactly what to say now i found the sweetest guy on this planet he treat wme well but is honest make me laugh but call me out on my shit support me but also tell me to be strong he make me laugh so much he make me feel safe and i only decided to be with someone after almost a year because i went through therapy month in my own and discovered myself the best i could cliché i know but it s a thing most day i feel so happy with my life i want to cry my problem now is that every now and then i become that girl again i apologise profusely for thing i don t need to i feel bad about my body when in reality i know i m beautiful last night when he spoonwd me from behind and came on to me felt me up i panicked because my mind suddenly went back to those moment and i felt i wa there all over again i don t understand why i keeping going back to this place it s sometimes a split second but those second have turned into hour of panic and flashback i don t want to have i love my boyfriend but i haven t had the courage to tell him because last time i loved someone they made me feel like a piece of shit help what do i do to make this go

advice needed to preface i ve been drinking but i m upset right now and i ve been considering posting here for awhile i ve been dating this guy for about half a half a year of course everything wa great in the beginning he wa great sweet caring understanding when we had argument we discussed them rationally i wa living in a shitty environment so i moved into an apartment with him in a different state i ve worked a couple minimum wage job since then bringing in what money i can but it s negligible compared to what he brings in he doe not hesitate to remind me of that he s gotten angry with me quite a few time to the point that he yell at me for every little thing when he come home from work i try to make sure everything is perfect for him so he isn t upset we met through a gaming discord so we game a lot when he come home i make sure i m not online because he tends to get upset when i am saying that i m not spending enough time with him it s gotten to the point that i ve stopped putting effort into making time for friend because any time i do spend with them he see it a me leaving him out and it cause a fight i try to spend every moment we have together he go to sleep a few hour earlier than me and i often lay down with him till he fall asleep because he s mentioned it make him happier once he s fully asleep i ll get up and knit watch tv or game with my friend but then if he wake up in the middle of the night he ll come out to see me doing my own thing and get mad he ll start slamming door he s tried to break up with me several time a month he claim i only stay up so late because i want to cheat on him about a month ago he got unexplainably mad that he pushed me into a wall and told me to leave i ended up locking myself in the bathroom begging him to calm down a he tried to cut through the lock to get in with a butcher knife since then he s been le angry and told me to be more open with him emotionally but i m dependent on him financially and i m frankly just scared a someone who is normally very dependent but followed my heart for once i find myself unsure of whether this is toxic or not i have my own fault that i contribute to the relationship i admit so freely but i also feel like he contributes his own and doesn t acknowledge this i ve told him no matter what jealousy insecurity and violence are not the proper method of action i believe this my friend reaffirm this yet here i am hoping thing improve sometimes i want to leave and other time i think i can stick it out a friend ha offered me a place to stay but it s in a completely different state and i m just torn any advice is welcome,1

the one who care the least ha all the power belief system is the foundation of abuse i had a friend who would use this statement all the time to justify my abuser s behavior and for a long time i believed him i believed that because my abuser saw me a worthless he had a right to treat me like i wa worthless i believed that because i cared about my abuser and wanted his approval that made me weak and pathetic i believed that my abuser wa a better person because he wa cruel callous and completely uncaring that my empathy wa my worst personality trait and my biggest weakness i just wanted to say that s all bullshit since when did being detached callous uncaring and cruel become value to strive for since when doe wanting to do good and be a good person make someone pathetic wanting love inclusion and approval from those around u is fundamentally human and a a human wanting these thing doesn t make me pathetic it make me human believing that someone is worthless doe not give you a free pas to treat them like they are worthless not caring about someone is not an excuse to intentionally treat them a badly a you can and if you really find your victim so disgusting unattractive and unlikable then stop sobbing every time they try to end thing using and abusing someone else doesn t make you strong it make you a user and abuser it take courage to love and show it freely caring is what give u strength in the face of adversity compassion is what make the world a better place to live in for all people you don t win by being cruel and uncaring all you do is destroy what others are trying to build and that make you the ultimate loser,1

incredibly supportive of my schooling and helping me with any family or friend issue we have gone on lot of trip together with his family and mine and he also come to visit me at school i also have depression and anxiety and he doe his best to support me and he try to understand how i m feeling and help me the best he can now the other stuff he ha bad anger issue in which he sometimes take out on me if i say something to upset him or if i say something he doesn t like it turn into a huge argument usually it little thing that upset him like me not telling him when i get home or when i get to school or if i say i m too busy to talk and when he get upset he blow up at me he s told me several time to go fuck myself fuck you he s called me stupid a bitch a privileged white bitch we got into an argument that had nothing to do with race and that i don t listen to him and i cry too much and it annoying etc etc i m on a club swim team here at my school and he is super uncomfortable with me going and at one point he told me i needed to get out of the pool a certain way so that no one would see my butt i know how ridiculous this all sound the team often go out for drink or dinner after practice and he doesn t like me going to that his excuse is that it s late and because he s so far he worry since he can t protect me i recently got a new puppy and i went to go pick her up by myself he hated the fact that i went by myself and forced me to stay on the phone with him while i talked to the breeder we were in a petsmart so it wasn t some random person house my phone hung up on accident and he wa calling and calling and i couldn t answer because i wa holding the puppy the bag of dog food and my wallet and i wa trying to talk to the breeder he got so pissed at me when i wa finally able to answer and told me not to talk to him the rest of the day when i took the puppy home i had her in a soft crate in the front seat because i m in the south and i don t have good air conditioning in the back seat and i didn t want her to overheat he called me a few hour into my trip back home and asked me where the dog wa i told him she wa in the front seat and he wa mad he said of course because you don t ever listen to me you re gonna get distracted by having her there i tried to explain to him my reasoning but he wouldn t have it a few week ago we got into an argument about where the best place to live is stupid i know and i told him he must really like yelling at me and he told me to go fuck myself and hung up he called me back several time and when i finally answered i told him not to call me back and that i wa turning my phone off since i wa at school when i finally turned my phone back on i got a text asking me if turning my phone off wa really how i wa going to handle my problem he texted me over and over asking me to call him so we could talk so once i got out of class i called him he told me that he wa so sorry and he understood if i wanted to break up with him i told him i didn t deserve to be spoken to like that and that when you love someone you dont talk to them like that and he said he knew that but didn t know why he said that to me he said he can t control his anger like i can t control my cry my parent were in town when this happened and i talked to them about it and they told me that in 35 year of marriage they have never spoken to each other like that and none of my aunt uncle cousin etc have been spoken to like that or have spoken to their significant other like that and that i do not deserve that also it is important to note that he hate me talking to my parent about our issue i tell him every time that s the relationship i have with them but he say he doesn t like it and tell me not to he came to visit me last week and it wa honestly miserable on the way home from picking him up from the airport we got into an argument in which he asked me why he wasn t my lock screen i told him i m never yours he said you are but i always reset my phone and it change it i said sureeee in a joking manner and he got pissed he said i wa calling him a liar and that coming to see me wa a mistake i apologized for what i said and told him i wasnt trying to call him a liar i don t care about a lock screen this is the last thing i want to mention we were laying in bed and i didn t have pajama short on just underwear my dog wa running around and she ended up having an accident on the floor i got up to clean it and put on some pant because i don t like walking around without clothes on i put her in her bed and got back into my bed with my pant on and he wa visibly irritated i asked him what wa wrong and he said that i wa leading him on and lying to him about not still being upset about our last fight that i wa making up any possible excuse to get out of sex i told him that i wasn t leading him on and i ended up sleeping on the couch the next morning he told me he wa sorry and he shouldn t have said that i wa leading him on but he felt like i told him i wa okay when it wasn t i told him he had no right to get mad and that i wa confused and that he doesn t understand what it like to be told those thing by someone that say they love you and that you love i know there may be an obvious answer to a lot of people but to me i am so conflicted i love this man so much and all i want is for u to work i love him and his family and would love to have a future with him but maybe i m just being blind i feel like i m too young to be dealing with something like this while he wa here he said something to me and made me feel stupid and selfish i called my parent because i wa scared of him and they called him and asked him to leave i know that i am an adult and should handle thing myself but i am so weak when it come to him i begged him not to leave and to just talk and work thing out i realize now that wa probably a stupid move and i should have just asked him to leave myself but i wa scared the next few day we talked and tried to be ourselves and he wa extremely apologetic and kept asking me why i wanted him to stay and honestly i don t even know why because i didn t want to lose him why would i want to be with someone like this i feel like part of me want to wait for him to be better and want to put up with this until he can be a better man i m asking reddit for some advice thank you for reading i apologize that this wa so long,1
boyfriend m31 refuse to marry me 28f after his friend s messy divorce we ve been together pretty much our entire adult life and we re both each other s first and only serious relationship he s one of those traditionalist who belief that it s the man s responsibility to take care of his wife and child so we ve held off on getting married until his business is making him an income passively so he ha more time to be a father everything wa going according to plan right up until a few day ago when a close friend s wife really did a number to her husband apparently they d been wanting to get divorced for a while a she had cheated on him almost the entire duration of their marriage but were fighting over who got the house some of his friend and his lawyer recommended that he not move out of the house a that could cause problem later on so he insisted on staying she must ve hated him because her plan to force him to move out wa to move her ap into their house and told him that he ha no right to force him to leave because she co owns the house understandably he became mad and started yelling so they called the police and accused him of domestic abuse so that he s not allowed to return to his home and will probably lose a lot more than he initially would have a divorce court here hate abusive husband yesterday i noticed my boyfriend wa being quieter than usual and it took him a while to speak his mind but when he did eventually talk he said that he doesn t think getting married is an option anymore because the entire legal system treat men like criminal by default etc when we settle dispute our way of resolving it is we both take a slip of paper and write a number between 1 10 how important it is that we get our way if the number are the same we talk until we decide what to do yesterday for the first time in the decade we ve been together we both chose the number 10 which mean that there is absolutely no room for compromise and he ha his mind set that he will not marry me he s told me that he ll always love me but if marriage is something that i need he can t give it to me and he wouldn t think badly of me if i left him i don t know what to do i ve been looking forward to the day that i could get married since i wa a little girl but at the same time he s the only man that i ve ever loved and i can t imagine a life without him i ve tried telling him that i would never do something so cold and disgusting to him and his response wa friend probably never thought that his wife could do something like this to him either and i don t have an argument for that it feel like my world is falling apart and i m being punished for someone else s mistake how do i convince him to change his mind and stop believing that there s a possibility that i d ever want to hurt him like this tl dr my boyfriend s friend s wife took advantage of the legal system to mess with her husband in the divorce and now my boyfriend s decided that he doesn t want to get married anymore,0

can anybody explain the behaviour of my 23m girlfriend 22f when i wa with her family at christmas i have been with my 22 year old girlfriend for about 4 year we have lived together for the past 2 5 since knowing her i have never spent christmas with her family this is mostly because i go visit my mum instead a she would otherwise be alone at christmas however my girlfriend ha always wanted to be with me at christmas and a a result she ha not spent christmas with her family for the past few year either this christmas we spent christmas with her family this wa a combination of because i thought it wa fair considering she ha missed the last few and because she wa practically begging me to go i got to their s a couple of day before christmas it is quite a long journey and the day leading up to it were pretty normal just like any other visit there wa nothing of note and everything wa going well however on christmas day itself this happened she barely interacted with me all day i put this initially down to just wanting to socialise with her family which seemed reasonable on the rare occasion she came near me she ignored most of what i said she spilled her drink over me accidentally when i informed her she said no one care and went back to ignoring me after not seeing her for hour she sat next to me and said something incoherent when i asked her what she said she angrily said drop it and sat elsewhere later i asked what wa wrong she told me not to talk to her i spent the rest of the day talking drinking and having fun with her family i viewed this a quite an achievement because up until that point i had never really felt a part of the family out of the blue she messaged me saying that she wa sarcastically happy your having such a fucking good time with my family and that nobody care about how she feel i somewhat snapped at this point in text and told her to sort out her attitude a i had given her many chance all day to say what wa nothing her and she wa being nothing but hostile towards me and only me she wa perfectly fine with everybody else when i wa heading off to bed at about 1am many hour later she intercepted me and had what can only really be explained a a meltdown she started shouting and then locked herself in the bathroom when her mum stood by the door to talk to her she swung the door open into her mum then said that she hoped it wa going to hit me instead i went to talk to her alone she demanded that i left her mum s house i couldn t be bothered to argue so just got my bag and began walking in the dark to the nearest town about halfway to the town somebody approached me it wa her mum she had driven around looking for me and insisted that i come back to the house and stay a her guest not my gf s guest i got back to the house and my gf s mum fetched me a duvet and pillow for me to sleep on the sofa shortly after i had lay on the sofa to go to sleep my gf stormed into the house and screamed at her parent for letting me back in when they refused to kick me out at 2am in the morning on boxing day morning when it wa 0 degree celsius outside she ran off her uncle went off to find her and i also got out of bed to join him we followed her onto a main road where we then lost her we searched for about 20 minute before turning back we found her hiding outside the house her uncle talked to her and told me to just go back to bed i did the following morning she essentially refused to acknowledge that anything happened she wa hungover and throwing up in the toilet and asked me to come in to help her a she usually doe when confronted by me or any member of her family about the night she didn t respond her mum asked her to apologise to me and to the other member of her family that had to stay up dealing with her in the early hour of the morning she refused to this day she still hasn t explained to anybody what wa wrong apologised or even mentioned what happened any attempt is just met with ignorance doe this sound like familiar behaviour to anybody here can anybody explain whatsoever what happened i am still completely dumbfounded tl dr gf insisted i went to her family s house for christmas i did she seemed to hate that i wa there she caused a massive scene one month on she doesn t even acknowledge that it happened,0

psychologically abused by ex i m pretty sure i ve been in an abusive relationship for the past 7 month it s been primarily been psychological emotional and verbal abuse from my girlfriend she tried to guilt trip me if i didn t make it to her place fast enough with dinner she would tell me i had poor time management skill i rarely if ever got an apology for her for even just hurting my feeling not even for doing something wrong she refused to even acknowledge that i wa hurt when we did argue she would gaslight and tell me that i needed to speak to her in a more appropriate manner even though all i wa doing wa laying out my side of the argument in a calm manner truthfully it got to the point where i began to question whether or not i wa even right about pointing out her abusive behavior she attempted to put up border between me and my family by essentially insisting that i stay with her most night she wa adamant about attempting to move in together even though both of u were in debt and were living with our parent to get it paid off finally in our last argument i told her that i thought it might make her mad but i couldn t shell out money on rent because i needed to get out of debt first i wa told that i should not have communicated that by text and that it wa wrong of me to give her false hope by changing my mind that wa the last straw and so now i m single i find myself feeling worthless and like i still love her through everything i don t want to go back because it wa abusive but all i can feel is a massive void where she wa in my life i thought i wa going to marry her life had other plan though am i wrong in saying that she wa abusive to me it seems to fit all the criterion or almost all anyway i just want to feel like i did the right thing,1
my boyfriend 29m and i 26f have issue with sex and i don t know how to talk about it with him anymore we ve been together for about a year now and are absolutely crazy about each other we re both madly in love and have a great relationship outside of this issue we have so much fun together and have a scary amount in common however sex is obviously a huge fucking issue i m not great at articulating my feeling so bare with me that s actually part of the issue i m not great at telling him how i feel and then he feel like i m criticizing him the issue is that i feel like my boyfriend is selfish lazy in bed if i want sex i have to be the one to initiate he almost never doe i ll initiate by touching him and trying to get him going normal foreplay but which is entirely focused on me doing stuff to him with him laying there with his hand behind his head he ll initiate by asking for it and leaving all the foreplay to me see above for what foreplay look like i also almost always have to be on top which mean he lay there with his hand behind his head and just let me fuck him or he ll occasionally put his hand on my hip boob if i want him to actually agree to sex if i start on top and ask him to switch to fucking me from behind my personal favorite or another position he ll say no and then either i ll continue on top or sex will stop our sex last for like 5 10 minute basically until he get off and he s in shape so it s not like it s a physical stamen issue then he ll make a comment about me blue balling him he s not entirely in the wrong there though because i do get upset with him when i ask for him to be on top and he refuse i can t even count the number of time that i ve given him a blowjob sometimes after he asks and sometimes just because i want to i m not complaining about this because i actually love giving blowjob i love hearing him moan and it get me going to know that i m making him feel like that what upset me is that i can count on one hand the number of time that he ha tried to get me off none of which were initiated by him i always had to ask for it a comment he made the other day about this actually really upset me i m looking at getting a clit piercing because i do have trouble orgasming and it s supposed to make it easier i mentioned to him that we wouldn t be able to have sex for awhile afterwards while it healed and he said but would i still be able to and i finished his sentence with yes i ll still give you a blowjob with kind of an attitude because i thought that s where his mind wa going because it feel like he only care about himself getting off then he get a bit upset and say i wa going to say touch you in that area to get you off it really upset me because he s literally never shown interest in getting me off and it feel like he only is now is because it s right after we started another argument about how selfish he is in bed we ve had this conversation so many time and now when i get upset about it he just say i m tired of talking about this we have this conversation so often or you criticize me all the time and then of course i don t want to have sex which is a fair point but i feel like nothing change after we have these conversation i give up for awhile and then i inevitably get frustrated again this honestly make me feel like he isn t attracted to me or passionate about me which he say is ridiculous but really he put very little effort into sex i ve tried just letting him initiate from now on but i always end up getting turned on by something and asking for sex at this point i don t know what to do anymore any advice tl dr my boyfriend is lazy selfish in bed i have to do the majority of the foreplay almost always have to be on top and give way more blowjob than he reciprocates he also doesn t want to talk about it anymore what do i do,0

i just don t feel the same about relationship anymore i know rationally that the chance of getting into a new relationship with another person with an abusive mindset is pretty low but i also know that it will be month potentially year before i can really be sure they aren t i guess there are warning sign i know to look for now but i m still scared that the people i meet will turn out to not be who they say they are or i ll miss the sign again i d rather be single than risk that bullshit again i m also afraid that i m going to over compensate and when a new partner make a minor mistake or us a tiny bit of guilt or a us a tiny bit of silent treatment or disagrees with my recollection of event that i ll freak out and insta terminate the relationship on the spot i also don t think i m ever going to feel the butterfly again i fell for my ex hard and to begin with loved her without reservation i thought i d found something for the long haul and piece by piece that dream wa replaced with the realisation she wasn t even a good person it s so weird to go from unreserved love to not even liking your partner and all that changed wa you finally got to know them how can my judgement be so poor there are people i sort of fancy now but it doesn t extend past that i think the part of me that could feel butterfly for someone is dead replaced with an instinct for self preservation anyway i m happy not being in a relationship it s not so bad i have time to do what i want and i don t have to worry about anyone else or trying to divine people s intention etc absolutely no possibility of psychological chess game also on an entirely mundane non abusive note that wa my 3rd serious relationship and the task of getting to know someone and introduce them to all the thing you love and learn about all the thing they love just seems like a chore i don t have any enthusiasm to do that all again i guess it s something i d like to do again one day but it just seems like an impossible task at the moment am i ever going to give someone a chance again,1

considering ending my 29f 3yr relationship 28m bf because of the chore saying this out loud sound so ridiculous but i am so exhausted it is obviously not just some chore it s the constant lack of respect i get for my time and effort i am all over the place because we just had a fight and also sorry for any mistake i m not a native english speaker i feel like he get to make decision that impact u both mostly financially and then i m stuck picking up the piece and making end meet couple of year back he lost his job and decided to go freelance freelance didn t work out great so he decided to take a job in another city after about a year i followed him and took a job in the same city where we live together a couple of month after we moved in he again lost his job said he will go freelance and this time is different it is a bit better but not long term sustainable he could find another job granted not a well paid a the previous one but he want to be his own bos that s great and all but he didn t have any saving so the financial factor is putting a strain on our relationship a well besides the whole chore thing i ve spent all my saving on moving here and now i have to support a lot of our shared expense chore wise since the past 6 month i moved here i ve done most of the meal planning cooking grocery shopping with mostly my money and most of the cleaning he doe vaccuum clean the cat litter and when he remembers do the laundry sometimes he ll do a bit in the kitchen i feel taken advantage of since i moved here i keep asking him to pick up or clean after himself but he almost always half ass it leaving me to spend my own free time doing it instead whenever i call him out he say he ha no time because he s working but i am working too full time and i don t want to spend my free time cleaning after him or he ll just act clueless or put the blame on me or he would point out that i forgot a pair of sock somewhere near the sofa last night and this one is the most irritating because it s not like i m asking him to clean the house spotless i would really like him to be more considerate about the place we re sharing together and he just doesn t seem to mind that all this extra work is falling on my shoulder we fought earlier because he added garlic in his soup and i asked him to wash the dish afterwards so it won t stink up the whole place he washed the pot and the bowl but he left the garlic press in the sink along with a bunch of cutlery i wa angry and yelled at him for leaving that in the sink he told me to stop being hysterical and that the cutlery is not technically dish he eventually start laughing in my face a i explained to him that ever since i move i feel like we have this constant fight and that he is not taking my concern seriously he told me that i m being a nag because of something so small if it is so small why doesn t he do it especially considering how many time i ve told him that it upset me i feel like i m talking to a teenager nearing his 30 who refuse to grow up i ve shown him all those mental load article and comic and he say he s seen them so what now doe he really not care could some chore really ruin my relationship tl dr bf keep taking irresponsible decision that impact u both financially without long term solution he doesn t do most chore unless asked and even then he usually half ass them even after numerous discussion and fight about it should i keep trying or am i beating a dead horse,0

should i 27m skip important personal obligation to see my little brother 17m play in the high school football state championship my youngest brother is playing in my home state s high school state championship this weekend i live about 12 hour away in a different state i really want to go see him play because i feel like i may regret it if i don t i love him a lot and it is his last football game a a senior there are a few thing holding me back from going 1 i just flew down 2 week ago to see him play for the first time in a regular playoff game 2 when i flew down that weekend i missed a volunteering session where i help mentor a low income high school student each week they are very strict about attendance and i would have to miss another session if i flew down again i don t think i would be kicked out of the program if i missed again but it s my first year participating out of a three year commitment and i don t want to get off on the wrong foot 3 i would also miss my company holiday party normally this wouldn t be a big deal but i work for a very small company where every cost relationship matter a lot they ve already paid for my spot at the dinner and i think if i cancelled this close to the date it would potentially rub my bos e the wrong way we are also very close to receiving our performance bonus for the year which is a major part of my total compensation and i wouldn t want to do anything to impact that 4 the flight are extremely expensive i don t care about this reason a much a the others but still probably worth mentioning i just can t shake the feeling that if i don t go i will regret it forever despite all of the reason i can come up with not to go i know that whatever consequence i face short term won t matter in the future when i look back and say i wa there with you bro but at the same time i already went to see him play if i hadn t seen him play yet i would absolutely go this weekend i m not worried about damaging any family relationship by not going they will understand if i don t go but will be disappointed i m really stressing about this and i basically need to decide today am i way overthinking this thanks for any input tl dr should i skip important personal obligation to see my little brother experience probably one of his most formative memory or not go and potentially regret it forever,0
my 38f boyfriend 42m of four year keep revealing unexpected talent i ve been dating my boyfriend dave for a little over four year the relationship ha been pretty smooth i feel like we are very compatible and he make me feel like he agrees we don t live together but when he isn t traveling for work we spend most of our time together this seems silly but i ve noticed a pattern of dave being unusually good at a lot of thing that he s never given any hint of i remember three or four month into our relationship when he decided to do some card trick at a mutual friend s party these weren t just any card trick though he had everyone spellbound with his patter and i swear people s jaw were falling open a he finished each trick ok everyone ha some dumb trick or whatever that they like to pull out and show off whatever maybe six month after that we were in the city and there wa an old school breakdancing crew set up on a corner and we stopped to watch dave started talking to a couple of them and pointed at the mat and they bumped fist and dave jump into the middle of the mat and start dancing dave look like an accountant he ha short blonde hair and big glass and he wa wearing khaki and a button down shirt i wa mortified because he looked ridiculous switching his foot around out there all of a sudden he doe a complete forward flip and he s like a flurry of foot and windmill and he even got in a head spin this is a 37 year old white guy and the crowd of 20 something dude is losing it s mind while he s dancing what the fuck it took fifteen minute to get out of there through all the slap on the back and fist bump i asked him where he learned to do that and he said he picked it up watching movie what about eighteen month into our relationship we visited a family friend of mine named dean dean is a big gun nut and he s turned a section of his property out in the country into some sort of training ground he ha dozen of target that swing around on arm or flip over when you shoot them he also ha two long lane divided by hay bale for shooting rifle dean demonstrated the training area while we watched and invited dave to have a go dave said no but dean asked a few more time and dave finally agreed dave started the course with one full clip magazine in his gun and another in his belt dean blew a whistle and dave went off on those target it wa all bang bang duck turn bang move bang bang bang he wa so fast i don t remember the actual number but he did the course in something like 20 second and that must have been a good time because dean wa floored i never even saw dave reload he wa moving so fast but the bullet in his belt weren t there when he came out the other side i guess dave wa pretty good on the rifle range too dean talked about both all night when i asked dave about it he told me he d had an uncle who wa really into gun and i guess the uncle taught him last year we were out at a new bar and they had karaoke i kept poking fun at him telling him to go sing me a song and he kept smiling and refusing i wa a little bit buzzed and i got kind of pouty because i really did want him to sing me a song so he did he put in a song and when it wa his turn to sing he wa unbelievable he sang a country ballad and my heart melted probably a dozen people stopped him on his way back to our table to tell him how good he wa after that he put in three more song and he wa amazing every single time he sang tom jones a song from phantom of the opera and bj thomas and he killed every one of them we had been together three year at that point and i had never heard him sing a single note except joking around and singing maybe part of a television theme song he could absolutely be singing on broadway or something i actually got a little jealous after what seemed like a hundred people stopped by to shake his hand and compliment him and at least six woman came by to ask him to sing duet with them dave travel often for work it s not constant but it probably add up to 8 12 week per year in chunk of anywhere from two week to two month at a time i think 2017 wa the worst year and he wa on the road gt 16 week that year the travel bothered me a bit at first but i adjusted maybe six month ago we were both traveling at the same time so we went to the airport together we were at a lounge in the airport and this group of guy in business attire were talking politics loudly enough for u to hear them they were going on about something that had happened in syria and dave wa listening in and frowning dave finally butted in which i have never seen him do and started explaining why they were wrong about what they were saying they argued with him and dave basically gave a thirty minute lecture about politics in the middle east he had fact and figure and an answer for everything those guy said at one point one of the guy in the group who had a mild accent said thank you and gestured at the other guy like he wa saying i tried to tell them dave almost never talk politics beyond watching the news i ve never seen him show a particular interest in global affair he sounded like he knew what he wa talking about in the airport and everything i wa able to remember and look up later checked out where is he finding the time to learn all this stuff how come he doesn t talk to me about it i would love to learn from someone who seems to know what he s talking about the most recent thing happened about two week ago we went to a restaurant at the suggestion of a friend who know the owner before we were seated our friend brings the owner out to meet u the owner introduces himself then dave introduces himself and say something that confused me it sounded like nonsense and i thought i had misheard him i look over and see the owner looking surprised then the owner say something back to dave and then the two of them are off on a five minute conversation in another language which i later learned wa tamil the owner brought his wife and daughter over and everyone seemed very happy to speak to my boyfriend in their own language what the hell is going on there we re four year into an intimate relationship and he ha never ever not once mentioned knowing another language i know this is really dumb but it s starting to bother me it feel like he is intentionally not sharing thing with me you can t just accidentally not mention that you speak another language for four year i don t speak tamil i didn t even know there wa a language called tamil but he sure seemed to be fluent he ha to be practicing right this isn t something he picked up in high school twenty five year ago and somehow still remembers why did i not find out about this until he s suddenly holding court in some restaurant the magic whatever the breakdancing weird but it s not like breakdancing come up a lot in conversation maybe he just never had a chance to wedge in that he wa a talented street performer the gun a little bit scary to be honest the karaoke bother me because i would love to have a boyfriend who sings to me he ha a beautiful voice he could have been singing love song to me for four year the language thing is honestly a little creepy because there s just no way he speaks another language at a high level and simply never mentioned it that one really feel like something he kept from me but if he wa keeping it from me on purpose why use it in front of me i feel so dumb even saying this but i feel like i m dating a slightly nerdy jason bourne dave make a lot of joke about his government paycheck and being a civil servant but i don t actually have a clear idea exactly which branch of the government he work for he say his job is logistics whenever someone asks it somehow never struck me a odd that i know so little about his work because he treated it so naturally i m sure my boyfriend isn t a superspy or anything but i am starting to think he doe something sort of secretive i really want to push him on this and find out what s going on but i don t want to come off a overbearing or untrusting these incident are the highlight off the top of my head but the relationship ha been full of smaller surprise that seem to add up to my boyfriend keeping thing from me and it hurt am i being crazy here i know you can never really know everything about another person but where s the line shouldn t i know that he can sing and speak multiple language if he s so into middle eastern politics isn t it reasonable for me to think he would have discussed them with me at some point i just don t want to feel like there s a ton of stuff he s intentionally not telling me tl dr my boyfriend breakdances speaks language i didn t know he spoke sings like an angel and is some sort of weapon expert and i never know about any of it until he doe something in front of me that let it slip,0

my 25f sister 43f refuse to have anything to with our half sibling 22m and 22m and it s causing friction basically my parent had my sister very young around 16 and ended up being pressured into getting married i also have two other sister who are 27f and 23f they had a pretty unhappy marriage because my dad wa an asshole towards my mother and my sister he s really conservative and traditional so he expected my sister to wait on him hand and foot and didn t really value her education and berated my mum for not giving him a boy all thing that i heard from my sister she ended up studying well getting into a good school taking out loan and even ha a phd now is now a millionaire basically from setting up a business in a really lucrative but niche stem field anyway my dad ended up having an affair and ended up having two boy twin he divorced my mum immediately and went to live with the other woman apparently a soon a he found out the gender i wa really young at the time so don t remember anything according to my sister my step mum also rubbed it in my mum s face that she wa able to give my dad two boy my mum never really recovered from all of this and my sister had to support her emotionally and financially until she passed away 3 year ago since my sister wa an adult at the time she refused to have anything to do with my father after that my father never wa that sexist or anything towards me but my sister showed me letter he d written to my grandma about how disappointed he wa we were girl and he would get disappointed every time we turned out to be girl which she found when she wa helping clear away my grandmother s thing after she passed my dad ha acknowledged that he s changed his mind about a lot of that stuff but say it wasn t a bad a my sister make it out to be that the housework she had to do wa just chore etc so i believe my sister when she say that my dad wa sexist he claim he wa never that bad but it s hard to say he wasn t an amazing dad by any mean but i did see him on weekend and stuff and he turned up to a few of my school thing but isn t great with stuff like birthday and he missed my high school graduation because he forgot but he did take u on a few holiday with my half brother and we kind of talk and meeting up once every couple of month my sister however hate him and hasn t had anything to do with him since the divorce she also refused to have nothing to with with my half brother in fact one time my dad tried to force her to babysit by dropping them off at her house but she wa so angry she called the police and told them my dad had abandoned them which turned into a huge thing with the police looking for my dad and cps getting involved that caused a huge issue with my cousin who had been siding with her up till that point to start criticising her and she cut them off they made up maybe 7 year ago however my sister refuse to come to event where they are present or my dad is present this ha caused issue during family event etc but my sister is quite firm she doesn t turn up if they will be there one time my cousin told u and her my dad half sibling would be there and when she came to the venue and saw them she turned around and left which caused an argument for day and she ended up cutting them off and then they reconciled again a couple of year ago my dad ha also been going around telling people how much he want to reconcile with her but she s refused to have anything to do with it my half sibling have also expressed an interest in getting to know her a well and tend to ask after her my dad also asks after her a lot from everyone but she s got him blocked on everything and i m not allowed to give my dad her phone number my sibling and i refused to carry message or push my sister into any kind of reconciliation at all and when we catch up we don t talk about my dad s side of the family at all in addition my sister ha also paid for all our college etc so my gratitude is to her not my extended family but she also refused to come any of my sibling s graduation celebration because my dad would be there which kind of hurt a a result my sister ha become really alienated from most of my dad s side of the family but she say she didn t care my mum s side of the family she doesn t particularly like either because she said they never supported her or my mum when my dad wa being an asshole just so they could stay married but she doesn t actively dislike them i feel like i wa so young when my parent divorced i haven t seen the worst of their marriage whereas my sister wa a direct witness it s all a case of she said he said the most recent issue wa with my dad s side where a few cousin reached out to her to try and include her again and we ended up planning a christmas getaway a a family then my dad and step mother raised a fuss a to why my half sibling weren t invited and my half sibling also expressed how hurt they were my half sibling in particular have been really hurt but how much my sister snub them when they haven t done anything wrong except being born but i ve always been firm about not carrying message or pushing for reconciliation a have my sister a cousin who had kept in contact with my sister all these year approached my sister about the possibility of my half sibling coming a long a well on the getaway my sister did not take it well she didn t yell or anything but she cut contact withdrew from the group chat and the holiday and cut off financial support from the cousin who had asked it turn out she d be paying for my cousin s kid s school fee so that they could go to a nicer school this in turn led my cousin to get desperate because she d just asked she wasn t going to push and she can t afford the school anymore for her child she pleaded with my sister but my sister just told her no and blocked her my cousin wa furious and ended up sending some really nasty message around how my sister wa going to die alone and she needed to get over what happened two decade ago she regretted it immediately and wanted to apologise but my sister had already blocked her my sister ha now blocked everyone except me and my sibling and ha withdrawn all financial support from every single one of my cousin from both my mum and dad s side she s been pretty generous with her money even if she doesn t keep contact with my cousin so that the kid can have a better education or go to college now my mum s side cousin are upset that she s withdrawn financial support when they haven t done anything and thought they d actually had a pretty good relationship with my sister now my full sister and i have family on both side asking u to mediate on behalf of them and my sister ha made it very clear she s completely and utterly done with any kind of extended family in any way at all and she doesn t care what happens to them i feel like she s also really done with me and my sibling too because she think we never really stand up for her when people push reconciliation or bad mouth her but that s not true we don t let anyone speak ill of her how do i go about even navigating this right before holiday do we at least advocate on behalf of my

desperately seeking advice i 30m genuinely feel like nobody like me working on it i ve always considered myself a a nice person but always kind of an oddball i never did thing the conventional wa always known for speaking my mind even at time others would consider inappropriate i ve always considered these a good quality a they made me kind of quirky which i liked about myself in the past 5 to 10 year that ha definitely changed for me in short i ve bumped head with so many people by now that it had me questioning my own sanity a i grow older i feel like it s becoming more and more difficult for me to actually connect with people and i m starting to feel more and more isolated that ha left me with a huge dent in my self esteem and i feel like that in turn is pushing people away from me i m constantly overthinking every situation and it ha left me incredibly paranoid snippy and easily defensive and overall feeling very lonely and constantly misunderstood the truth is that i love having people around me but for whatever i just don t feel comfortable around others anymore i always feel like the weirdo or am at least heavily convinced that s the way other people say me which in turn make me angry and bitter deep down i don t feel i m a weirdo i just feel misunderstood at the moment there are very few people that do seem to fully understand me a a person and with whom i feel comfortable and my partner of almost 7 year isn t even one of them at the moment which worry me i m currently trying schema therapy though i m not yet sure if it s going anywhere we mostly talk about certain situation i ve been in how i acted in them and try to figure out why i acted the way i did and how others might have interpreted it turn out i apparently put up this angry and faux self assured front just so others can t see how little i really feel a soon a people point out even the slightest flaw in me i get defensive because deep down i think very little of myself we keep coming back to this session after session which is great and all but i m not yet sure how to turn that knowledge into something good it s not like i can tell everyone how i truly feel about myself deep down all the time and expect everyone to see right through me and take it into consideration whenever i display defensive or negative behavior or whatever maybe i sound like a selfish ahole here but i genuinely don t know what to do with this i just want people to like me again and be comfortable with being me again but the more i want that the more pressure i put on myself and the weirder my behavior get which eventually will push people away sometimes i m so done with feeling like an outsider again i just want to crawl under a rock and never come out again but so far i keep trying to hang out with people no matter the negative feeling i usually get in the end it s a long story i know and i m not here for up vote at all i m just desperaly looking for advice from someone who ha either dealt with this personally or just someone who doesn t look at this from psychologist s perspective tl dr i m having trouble connecting with people more and more and it s making me question my sanity am currently trying schema therapy where i ve learned i put up a front opposite of how i really feel which put people off problem is i don t know how to find the right way to do thing differently,0

she revealed she s an escort just a we re getting serious tl dr we re getting serious she told me she s an escort i really like her and want to be cool with that it s killing me so i ve been seeing this girl for a few week it s starting to get serious i really really like her she really really like me i hope we have like a zillion thing in common she give me butterfly feeling we make each other laugh only now there s a wrench thrown in so when we met she wa sketchy on telling me what her job wa she told me she wa an artist which is true she paint and draw and is really talented she seemed very well off and wealthy which i know is unusual for someone supporting themselves on creative work i should make clear i don t feel lied to she told me early on that there wa something that she wasn t ready to tell me that could change how i felt about her kinda giving me an out i thought maybe she wa a felon or had a mental health thing something you d need to tell somebody you were serious with but that would be a little heavy for the first few date actually this combined with her being sketchy about her job made me think she wa some kind of cam girl or something like that i knew she wa probably making too much money to just be an artist but i also thought maybe it wa family money or something like that i mean she s loaded well we started getting serious so she told me the big secret she s an escort and like high class she doesn t do drug there s no pimp or anything like that she s super safe about it the guy who are her client are incredibly wealthy i know all this because in the shock of first being told i tried to be like super cool about this oh awesome it like you re a secret agent no of course i don t have a problem so she really opened up gave me more information than in hindsight i wanted because now it s all driving me crazy i know that this would sound like bragging or something if it didn t feel like hell for me when she thought i wa cool with it she kinda tried to show me there were perk for me like she asked me to pick out a lingerie set for her and guy the option she gave me were in the 1 000 5 000 dollar range each apparently she get picked up in limo for her client it s crazy the reason i m including these detail is that she make so much that it s pretty clear she couldn t just quit and find a job that pay anywhere close to that much i also want to say she gave me an out about sex we had sex before she told me and she wa like i didn t want to do this until i told you my secret are you sure when she said the secret wa not an std i went ahead because i m a guy and of course i did we used protection she always us protection with her client i don t feel like she s wronged me in any way i support sex worker i m not the jealous type usually i really wish i wa cool with this i don t have a moral problem with it hypothetically i m fine with dating an escort i really wish i could flip a switch and not feel incredibly jealous and worried but it is killing me asking her to change job isn t even on the table even if she could change job and maintain her income it would be super fucked for me to try to get her to change her whole life for me especially this early i feel incredibly guilty for not being supportive and she can now tell i m hurting even though i ve been very clear that if there s a problem it s mine not hers i really like her am probably falling for her could see u being together long term i have really tried to be cool with this but it hurt a lot i wish i wa secure enough to be fine but when i know she s with client it s like mr brightside i can t stop thinking about it and it make me miserable she can tell i m struggling but i have not been passive aggressive not tried to change i ve tried to be really clear that i support her it s just my jealousy and shit do i end this keep going and hope my feeling change is there some middle ground i m not thinking of a support group for the boyfriend of sex worker whack myself on the head and hope it make me le jealous any help would be appreciated more than anything i just needed to vent this,0

it s been 7 month since i got out of my abusive relationship but it still effect me i wish i could forget it all ,1
i m scared and scarred and feel trapped hi everyone amp x200b this is going to be quite a long post but i please read it i really need some guidance first time posting on here so i ll give you a bit of background i m m30 wa with my ex fiancee for five year bought a house got a dog planning a wedding etc we split about 18 month ago since then i ve struggled with depression huge anxiety suicidal thought some day worse than others and seem to have convinced myself that i will never move past her i ll never be with someone else and if i do end up with someone else they either won t live up to her or they ll figure me out and ditch me this is actually really hard for me to write out because even a i type this i feel i m being dramatic playing the victim and exaggerating thing i guess my heart know this wa a mentally abusive toxic manipulative relationship but my head is trying to convince my heart that i m being pathetic and if i told this to others they d look at me and think this guy being such a wimp i ll list a few thing that have stuck with me she ended the relationship a a way of punishing me she didn t want it to be over but wanted to regain control she told me that she left hoping i d come chase her bang down her friend door and beg for her back the truth is i wa so mentally and physically drained i didn t have the energy or mental capacity to do this in her word she said the minute we bought this house you thought i ve got her now did buying a house together make me feel more secure of the relationship of course but that s just a normal isn t it she also told me on numerous occasion that if i d turned up at her door with a bunch of flower and apologised that she d have come home a my family will testify to this i did everything but get on my hand and knee and beg for her back what kind of a person say that to someone she ended the relationship and then told me it wa my fault we didn t get back together the thought that it wa my fault we aren t together anymore still eats at me to this day we lived with my parent for a few year before we bought our own place and on occasion we would be making a cup of tea together joking around and she would take her tea bag out then tap the spoon on my hand basically burning me at the time i didn t think anything of it and thought it wa just a bit of fun and joking around but now i think there wa more to it my mum ha also told me that she saw that once and literally had to leave the room because she wa so angry from about the sixth month point in our relationship anytime we had an argument over the smallest thing the relationship would be in jeopardy she would threaten to end the relationship and this left me apologising constantly and in a state of anxiety most of the time i ve always been a slightly anxious person and like to know that i m in control of thing and on a two week holiday to florida with her mum and young brother i became slightly anxious it s an unfamiliar place far away from home i run my own business with my family and wa trying to slip in a bit of work now and then which i constantly got berated for from her if she saw me pick up my laptop she would fly off the handle and call my family lazy and say they can t cope without me etc etc and say that she didn t want to be with someone that couldn t take time away from work i carried this huge anxiety with me the whole holiday about a week after returning to the uk my family went working away and were scheduled to be away for about two three month she knew that wa going to be such a stressful time of year for me a i d have to look after four dog and run our family business single handedly so admittedly i wa quite stressed out anyway she go and visit her friend for the night and come back the next day i pick her up from the station and she immediately say what s wrong with you other than being stressed and a bit nervous about work etc i told her there wa nothing wrong that evening we ended up falling out and the next day she broke up with me again it crippled me and i struggled to work properly or even just get through the day my family had to come back from working away and help me out anyway a couple day later we patched thing up and got back together like nothing had happened another notch of my self esteem wa taken away god the anxiety those first few month back together caused me is indescribable i became a very self conscious person about the way i looked and the clothes i wore she knew this and she to wa also incredibly self conscious knowing this didn t stop her from criticising me if i wore something she didn t like i used to have this zip up north face fleece that i loved it wa warm and cosy and i thought looked really cool anyway she hated it and made sure to mention that each time i put it on i remember going into her work once where she worked with two other woman and i wa wearing some trainer jean and said fleece and she said god you look like a dad that fleece is so unstylish right in front of these two woman i felt so small a few week later she wa stripping some paint at home and wore my fleece and accidentally burnt load of hole in it not the only time she d ruined a piece of my clothing accidentally i d often try and do nice thing like clean our bedroom or make the house look lovely and she d say it looked nice but there would always be something i hadn t done properly that she d make me aware of it wa never good enough i remember going food shopping for u one weekend while she wa away and when she came back she decided to mention that i d bought the wrong thing or i d spent too much money etc etc i couldn t do anything right if ever we got into bed and i wasn t in the mood for sex she would make it into a huge thing that i didn t find her attractive or she d say that all her friend boyfriend jump at the chance to have sex with their partner whenever they get chance again this led me to feeling like there wa something wrong with me it also became a psychological battle in my head whenever we did have sex lasting long enough maintaining arousal etc and it stopped feeling natural to me to the point where i actually stopped enjoying normal sex with her i guess i ve always been a fairly anxious person i ve struggled with panic attack and anxiety all the way through my life but a our relationship developed that anxiety got worse and worse the thing with my anxiety is that it s all about me not being in control or feeling comfortable if i felt comfortable then there wa no anxiety my anxiety typically manifest itself in me needing the bathroom if we were having a really good time and she wa in a particularly loving mood my anxiety wouldn t bother me but if thing were a bit unstable my anxiety would linger constantly going out for dinner together became such a mental battle for me because if i did get slightly anxious and need to go to the bathroom she d make a big thing out of it and would often say it s ruined our evening now when you ve had an anxiety attack you aren t feeling strong you feel incredibly weak and vulnerable that s not the sort of thing you want to hear we used to argue and she d throw thing at me shoe empty water bottle her engagement ring we got a puppy it wa what we both wanted but the moment we got the dog he wa my responsibility he came and still doe to work with me every day i d get up and walk him before work i bought him training mat to potty train him etc but she would do thing to totally undermine everything i wa trying to teach him if she wa up early in the morning she d take him downstairs feed him make her coffee and go back upstairs she wouldn t open the back door because it wa too cold so i d come down and find he d been to the toilet all downstairs i asked her so many time not to do that my family went on holiday for a week and i went to live at their house to look after their four dog while they were away she stayed at our place and looked after our dog at the end of the week i moved back to our home and asked her if she d been walking the pup because he d been unusually hyper at work she finally admitted that she hadn t walked him once since i d been away this puppy quickly went from being a beautiful joy to being another thing i had to deal with alone another way she could manipulate me if we ever argued about something for the dog she would say you wanted the dog etc don t get me wrong i love my dog so much but she made me really regret and resent getting a puppy because i felt so alone caring for him she stayed in contact with me when she eventually moved out of the house emphasis on she because a much a i didn t want u to not be together i decided that if there wa nothing i could do then i wanted to move on with my life it wa too painful otherwise i deleted her number and deleted all of my social medium but she kept texting me and calling me and because we had a mortgage and thing to sort out i had to speak with her whenever we spoke though she would twist the knife i d try to be civil and she d say that i just don t care so i d plead with her to come home and she d tell me it s too late she told me the only way she d come back to me is if i quit my job left the company i started with my family from scratch and we moved away what she wa saying is that i needed to choose between her and my parent and my brother who is also my best friend not only wa that a choice i couldn t make but someone should never ask you to do that anyway one night at the weekend she call me at about 2am i don t answer and she keep calling i finally answer because i m worried something ha happened she begs me to come and see her she s in tear and say she need me i drive to the place she is now living with two of her friend we sit in my car cry and talking she asks me to stay with her i agree but a we are walking upstairs i tell her that i need to be honest with her i had a one night stand with someone the weekend before it meant nothing and i haven t spoken to her since but i had to be completely honest with her so she could make an informed decision immediately she start berating me insulting the other girl who she doesn t know saying i bet she s fat and really ugly to me that wa more insulting me saying that i couldn t get with anyone attractive she decides she doesn t care and we go to her place we have sex and the next morning i go home i m in a state when i get home i m cry i m anxious i m being sick i can t function my parent come round because they re really worried about me she text me and say would i like to meet up i agree and we end up spending the day together when i pick her up though i notice a feeling inside me she say to me this is the first time in week that i ve felt safe and not anxious all i keep thinking is how anxious i actually feel we go for a walk and then decide to get some food while choosing what to order she say to me i ve slept with someone it floor me we weren t together her sleeping with someone isn t really any of my business but it s the fact that she didn t tell me the night before because if she had i wouldn t have come up to her room and i d have gone home knowing that the relationship wa truly over she robbed me of my ability to make my own choice and again i felt manipulated and like i wa now competing for my fiancee she came back to my our house that evening and i broke down i confessed everything to her i told her i wanted to die i d thought about killing myself every day and i wa just generally in a horrible place she comforted me etc and then the next day we both went off to work that evening she asked me to come round to her place which i really hated by the way because we d bought this lovely house together and there she wa three week later already living in another place with friend i didn t like we ended up arguing because i wa still feeling really anxious and we went to bed without talking the next morning i woke up in flood of tear and she just looked at me and began texting her friend she wouldn t even engage me i guess the last bit of power i found forced me out of bed i stood up and told her i can t do this anymore and i left i haven t seen her since the above are just some of thing that went on over the course of the five year together and the relationship ha left me dreadfully scarred and hurting massively it wa only last night that i really began examining why she still hold so much sway over my life and it clicked i m scared of her not scared in the typical sense that she could physically hurt me but scared in the sense that if i bumped into her she would do something to chip further away at my self esteem i don t think i ve ever lacked a much confidence a i do at this moment in time i m working on all this with my therapist and we ve focused on becoming more independent and adult and that s really helped and is working great but i feel i now need to spend more time unpacking the above because ultimately this is what s holding me captive obviously throughout our relationship we had amazing moment moment where she d make me feel like a king she d buy me great present for my birthday throw surprise the sex wa amazing mostly and that s kinda what make this situation even worse because it confuses me into thinking that she wa the best i ll ever find i m not dating at the moment i compare everyone to her i m choosing people based on what my ex would think of them if we bumped into her in the street how can i date someone if i m scared of going out for dinner with them and seeing my ex the people that i have hooked up with since the split have been totally wrong for me i ve not even really been attracted to them but because of the past relationship i feel it s all i m worth i just don t know how to stop myself feeling that way i used to enjoy the little thing in life spending time alone watching film going for a beer with a friend but all i ever feel now is fear i know that tomorrow i ll be thinking about her and it make me angry it make me not look forward to anything the last i knew she wa dating someone new this come into my head a lot and i feel sorrowful sorrowful because she s been able to move on pretty easily and i m here in excruciating pain she s convinced me that i m unloveable so much so that i actually shut myself off from my friend and my family growing up with an alcoholic father had an impact on how loveable i felt but that pale in insignificance to what i feel now i long for the day i can walk around without fear when i can buy a piece of new clothing without thinking what would she think of this or she would hate this i better not get it i m so conscious of my weight a i m scared if i bump into her or she see a photo of me that she ll go back and tell all her friend oh he s put on weight etc i know i m not supposed to give two shit about her or her friend or what she think of me but i do i do care this way of thinking dictate everything i do i can no longer wear a fleece i can t just pop on any old clothes to go to the shop for milk or to walk the dog i even try and get into my house a quickly a possible when i get home for fear she s driving past and see s me joining a site light tinder or bumble is out of the question in case she or one of her friend see me on there tell her and she think god he s so desperate going on a dating

don t even look forward to going to sleep because i dream about her most night and they aren t happy dream they re made up dream which involve her tormenting and manipulating me and me feeling worthless amp x200b i m sorry if the above feel like rambling nonsense i find it hard to formulate these thought into word it s also very painful for me to remember these thing i m just hoping that people who have been through this share their story and word of wisdom with me i want to know that it get better i want to know the thing i can do i feel so lost and afraid and i m scared this is what the rest of my life is going to look like amp x200b please help amp x200b thank you for taking the time to read,1

advice for losing friend to your abuser hello i ve been struggling lately with having lost a lot of mutual friend after the breakup because they ended up staying friend with my abuser and not me partially because he d convinced them he wa the victim in the relationship none of these friend have really reached out to me and a few have gone a far a saying what i went through wasn t abuse i understand that if they really cared about me they would have reached out sooner or at all but i guess to be fair i haven t reached out to them either it s really painful knowing that they still regularly talk to the person that made my life hell for so long just wondering if anyone else ha any advice on this when we broke up i expected losing my partner to be the hardest part atleast the partner i thought i fell in love with but it s really the friend i lost because of it that i m having a hard time with now,1

i ruined my child according to my father my kid were nice but then i ruined them i guess by leaving their abusive father demanding child support and setting healthy boundary i ruined them i showed them how to stand up for myself and not allow someone else to tell me my worth i guess that ruined them i guess because my daughter ha been disrespectful to me it s my fault for allowing it because they would have never allowed me to speak to them that way of course considering the abusive childhood i endured and parent who told me that nice girl don t cause problem so i shouldn t say anything to friend who were treating me terribly i raised my daughter to stand up for herself she know she can tell me how she feel and i won t invalidate it and if that mean i have to deal with some preteen disrespect following her family being torn apart because of her cheating abusive father then i ll gladly deal with that according to my mother i should have stayed with my abuser because i would be better off financially i guess i should endure financial abuse to be more secure i guess when my husband of 17 year told me he didn t love me anymore i should have said too bad and refused to leave i guess when he told me he didn t want to be married to me anymore i should have worked harder to save a toxic abusive marriage i guess even though they can see i m le anxious and much happier i should have stayed with my abuser because he wa the right kind of guy with the right kid of family and the right kind of job never mind that he treated me so badly i had regular break down never mind that whatever his parent did to him a a child turned him into an abusive narcissist never mind that he worked so much he never spent any quality time with me or the kid and then blamed me for how much he had to work a though i controlled his job let s just ignore all of the damage he did to me and my kid i ruined them yup that make total sense,1
it s my daughter 4th birthday today and my husband mad at me because i answered a phone call from my mom and sister so they could sing happy birthday i woke up early with the girl my 4year old and 6 month old because i m mom and i need to make birthday pancake i let my husband sleep a he ha to leave for work at 9 30 by a huge surprise he wake up early i assume because the smell of bacon and hang out on the couch i said oh good dad awake do you want to open present my daughter jump for joy and scream yes at this point there s probably about 30 minute before my husband need to be out the door for work we open one present taken out of the box and started playing with it then my sister and mom call on group chat to say happy birthday to my daughter i pick up and the phone call lasted le than 5 minute maybe 5 minute exactly but not a minute over once i hang up my husband get so mad at me your family ha no boundary if they call while we re opening present you don t answer and have them call at a better time you re selfish and only think about you like what i answered so my daughter ha people saying singing happy birthday to her and she feel loved now because of the 5 minute phone call he blaming me for him being late for work now he s not going at all like really now there is so much tension all because i answered i think he wouldn t care that i answered if he liked my family but because he doesn t he s throwing a huge fit i wouldn t have answered had i known it would ruin our whole day i apologized and offered to make him a plate of breakfast but he said no and left to take a shower i honestly want to know if i m in the wrong even if i wa in the wrong it wa a 5 minute call and there shouldn t still be tension over this,1

my 27f bf 27m cancelled our plan to see my family for christmas because he ha to work i know the title doesn t sound great but bear with me i m feeling really conflicted and need advice i hope this make sense obligatory tl dr at the bottom here we go my bf 27m and i 27f have been together for 3 year living together for 2 we live a 30 minute drive away from his parent and 9 hour away from mine who are in a different state we originally moved in together because he wanted to move closer to his family his grandfather had passed recently and i had been accepted into my dream phd program at a university near his hometown it made sense the result is that i see my parent maybe twice a year and we see his family at least once a month so we agreed that we would take turn with our family over christmas one year with his family the next with mine etc this year surprise is my family s turn we had been talking about it for month planning how we were going to drive to see them for a few day over christmas and then drive home in time to go back to work we both usually have 2 week scheduled leave over christmas and for the most part of this year he told me no different then suddenly in october he tell me that he hate his job and want to move to another company okay fine i want him to be happy at work so i wa supportive he s really good at what he doe so he walked straight into another company everything wa good but i wanted to confirm if christmas plan had changed with the new company he said no so i carried on a normal fast forward to the middle of november my bf is much happier at work and much happier at home but he come home and say he ha some bad news he told me that he ha to work over christmas only getting the public holiday off and he say he need to make a good impression with his new bos and can t afford to take time off i mean i wa disappointed but i understood it happens and you do what you have to do he also mentioned that he would negotiate time off for the week after christmas so that we could still go and see my parent during the holiday totally acceptable not a problem my parent understood and said that we d just have a special family day the week after so that i wouldn t miss out since i don t get to see my extended family any other time there is also the added emotional dimension of this being the first christmas without my grandma who we lost earlier this year so it s extra important for that side of the family to all get together during this time a far a i wa aware we d made a compromise and everything wa good then i asked about the holiday that my bf had scheduled for the end of november he wa meant to be going overseas for a week long bachelor party with his buddy which i assumed would also be subject to the can t afford to take time off thing nope he wa still going to that and taking extra day off to recover when he got home umm okay i mean he d already paid for his flight and accommodation and everything so it would be a big financial sacrifice not to go and i ended up thinking that wa fair enough then last night he come home from work and i d made a mental note to ask about detail for when we re going to see my parent i d been on the phone with mum earlier in the day and she just wanted to confirm when we were coming before i get a chance to do that his phone start going off and he say oh friend s looking for idea for his buck night his friend is getting married in march i assumed that wa when the buck night would be but no my bf tell me it s going to be in january his friend life in the same state a my parent 9 hour away so i said that it d be difficult for my bf to manage going in two day especially if he ll be hungover on the sunday for the drive home and have to work monday how doe he respond i ll just take the friday and the monday off i m my own bos now i can take time off whenever i want news to me so i ask about when we re going to see my family for the holiday and he hit me with i told you i have to work we ll go when the job s finished well when will the job be finished i don t know i ve never done one of these project before you said we were going after christmas no i said we were going when the job wa finished that s not what he said so when will the job be finished i don t know you re a smart guy estimate i dunno a month a month and a half so here we are week from christmas and i ve made no arrangement to travel to see my family because i believed that we were going the week after christmas to see them when in fact my bf meant that we were going in february when he s finished this job because he can t take time off and ha to make a good impression but when it s something that he want to do like a bachelor party i m my own bos i ll just take time off i m aware that i could be letting my emotion about my grandma get in the way and that s what s upsetting me but i feel like i ve had the carpet pulled out from under me am i overreacting he said that he would understand if i wanted to fly over and spend christmas with my parent should that be enough what do i even do now change plan and try and get to my parent for christmas or wait and try and salvage getting to have holiday with my bf please help tl dr my 27f bf 27m made plan with me to see my parent for christmas this year then suddenly changed them when he got a new job because he wanted to make a good impression and not take time off but is happy to take time off for two separate bachelor party while i have to wait a month for u to see my family,0

i 38m unsure what to do with dying fiance 35f i m really struggling with what to do right now and feel like my bias are making a mess of the situation just for context about 4 year ago now i had a very nasty divorce that would have fit in well on an episode of murray i went through about 2 year of depression and self destructive behaviour more or le mourning the loss of my son and finally a bit over 2 year ago i started to feel like i could start building my life again literally a month later an ex g f from my teen reached out to me to apologize for how thing had gone between u decade prior before long she said she had feeling and a i got to know her better i started to catch feeling a well the problem wa i live in ontario canada and she now life in texas with her two kid i visited a number of time and she wanted to move to a new house so we made plan that she would move and i would join them for a few month and if all worked out we d start the immigration process most of my saving were depleted so the agreement wa she would buy the house in her name and i would sell everything in canada and use those fund to get situated in the u we would literally talk for 3 hour every day on the phone discussing our life and making plan so there wa very little ambiguity but then she decided it would be better to move to michigan to get away from her abusive ex husband and the trouble began to summarize twice we travelled to michigan to look at house only to find the perfect home and be sitting with the realtor to make an offer only for a previously unmentioned reason she would magically appear but other then this i felt i had found my family her two kid felt like my kid and she wa way out of my league in so many different way but just loved me for reason i ll probably never understand twice already we had very nearly had a child together but sadly it never carried i honestly felt the problem here wa so many people had let her down in the past that she believed she would move and i wouldn t show up so i committed the strongest way i knew how and asked her to marry me we tried again in april 2019 this time with me offering to contribute 95k usd just to make it happen but it still wasn t enough so i started to coast i let my relationship with her daughter slide because i thought we would never be a family so why perpetuate the disappointment finally i got the date for one of her many concert wrong and wished her luck 2 day after it happened and we ve never really talked since something that weighs on me greatly now in may 2019 they found something suspicious on my now fiance s rib cage it turned out to be nothing but over the summer further examination showed she had stage 4 throat cancer and it had spread to a number of place there is the slight chance a very dangerous surgery may be possible in jan 2020 but she could easily die be severely crippled or a vegetable the first chemo treatment didn t slow anything down so she s elected to stop her ex husband is back and is the only option to help with the kid after she s gone now practically life in the same house although doe little but shout discipline leaving my fiance to struggle with being in pain and tired all the time while bringing both kid to school 2 swim practice every day cook and clean etc etc all by herself with a man who tried to kill her multiple time living in the guest bedroom it honestly break my heart watching her do this alone and shes rapidly shutting down emotionally we hardly talk she doesn t really engage with anything i say and i don t know what to do anymore i ve offered to move there for 6 month legal max get my own place if need be just help in any way i can but this could cause her ex to abandon the kid in a huff so she asked me not too the last time i saw her wa in october and it s becoming a real struggle especially this week with christmas i increasingly feel torn between pinning for a family i ll now never have but still care greatly for and this growing sense of why am i doing this to myself and hating that i feel so selfish but how doe one maintain a long distance relationship with no prospect of it becoming real and no meaningful communication am i an asshole if i leave i don t want too but i also feel myself shifting towards a downward spiral she s invited me to come to her surgery consult in january and i ve agreed but i m feeling guilty and disingenuous because i don t honestly think i can do this for another 6 month or so and the voice in the back of my head is saying look at all the time she sabotaged the move look at how little it bothered her when those event made your life a struggle let her go she say it help to know she s loved and someone is concerned for her she want me to stay but understands if i can t tldr long distance fiance is dying from throat cancer and is emotionally shutting down i can t be with her and communication is becoming near non existent and lacking emotion i m not allowed to move closer and the sense of loss and losing my family again is making it hard to function i don t know what to do anymore,0
is this abuse i have a list of thing that it took me a long time to realize how it wa hurting me my so 27 and i 32 have what i feel like is a very toxic relationship i ve put here thing which i ve been realizing through my therapist and i m looking for some validation that i m not crazy silent treatment for mistake even if i offer a heartfelt apology they say sorry is too easy or don t believe i m sorry telling me to change the way i ask thing for example if i say do you want to ride with me instead of ride together with me telling me not to even speak my best friend s name who they despise in their presence telling me i should know why they re upset and how to fix it being condescending and abrasively yelling at me for perceived slight telling me that if they have to tell me to do something it s not worth doing anymore for example dropping in to say hi when coming home from the gym but since they told me they would like it they said i can t do it now it wouldn t work for them were the word you know typing this i see the answer that i need but could i be the one making this so bad is it immaturity or something that will or can be changed are there resource that i can use to figure out how to avoid this in the future,1
gf 19f think it s inappropriate that i 19m bathe my sister 7f i sometimes help bathe my sister i generally help her into the tub and fill it to a certain level then she clean herself and i just check on her until she s done she also play with her toy and there s a lot of goofing around for some reason my gf think that being around her when she s naked is inappropriate i can t say i understand her reasoning really she told me a few day ago when she wa staying over in my room she wa at my home earlier that day when i bathed her so she knew and didn t like it she said she didn t think it wa appropriate for me to be around and that she wa able to bathe herself on her own according to her her parent stopped bathing her at some early point like 5 or 6 and she think it s not appropriate to bathe a child older than that especially a girl i think it s important to say that her parent are chinese immigrant and they are really conservative she s an only child her parent were born very poor didn t get a lot of education and have run a minimart since they got here i guess it wouldn t surprise if this wa some deeply ingrained belief that is common for them but my gf is a lot more educated than them so i kinda didn t see it coming how should i talk to her about this how can i tell her that it s actually totally normal to take a bath with your little sibling or just bathe them tl dr gf think it s inappropriate to bathe my sister how to explain to her that it s actually normal and ok,0
how the little thing add up to abuse these are the kind of thing by covert narcissist ex husband did during our 17 year marriage these are those little thing that on their own aren t terrible but added together left me confused and very lonely in my marriage i thought he wa just an insensitive inconsiderate asshole at time now i know better these are red flag i wa just conditioned to believe that these were normal my father wa verbally abusive and my mother codependent he wa never physical he never crossed that line the thing he did were mean but hard to pinpoint a abuse that wa all by design what he did he told me that if i wa mad i could sleep on the couch he wasn t leaving his bed if he didn t have a problem likewise he told me he would never allow me to kick him out of the house if i wa mad because again it wasn t his problem why it s abuse the purpose of these remark wa to let me know that his feeling were more important than mine he did it under a guise of equality why should the man be the one to leave but it wa the opposite his comfort mattered more than mine his boundary counted but mine didn t what he did he would get mad at me when i wa mad at him why it s abuse this is a classic abusive method to blameswitch and turn it around on the victim what he did he complained when i raised my voice an iota because i wa yelling at him and it wa disrespectful because he talked to me about it and i refused to try to change why it s abuse he wa the master of subtle manipulation and intentionally pushed my button whenever i got slightly upset he would do this to turn the focus from himself onto me i wa the problem not him he actually got calmer the more upset i got which made it easier for him to say i wa out of control crazymaking what he did i wa not allowed to end a conversation if i did i wa rudely walking away from him and deciding the conversation wa over without his input why it s abuse this is another abuse tactic to maintain control it disrespected my boundary by not allowing me to walk away when i needed to what he did frequently i would talk to him and he simply wouldn t respond in any way to the point that i had to ask him if he heard me when he said yes i would tell him it s customary to respond to someone when they are speaking to you weirdly he never had this problem with anyone else why it s abuse this showed me that i wasn t worth him even taking 3 calorie of energy to uh huh a response it left me confused and frustrated what he did he hated my sleep schedule i had so much anxiety which i now know wa largely because of him that i had trouble falling asleep at night i ve also always been the kind of person who need around 9 hour of sleep to function well he always hated that and acted like something wa wrong with me because i didn t follow a normal sleep schedule i never understood why it mattered why it s abuse my sleep pattern wa inconvenient for him because i didn t jump out of be and be a stepford wife making him breakfast with a pretty smile on my face and heel on my foot my need in this case a basic need wa incompatible to his need so he had to let me know there wa something wrong with me what he did we would run errand and then he would get into the deep conversation just a we parked in the driveway and i wa basically held hostage in his car until he felt we were done there were so many time i just wanted to go in the house but he insisted we finish the conversation why it s abuse being in a car is actually a dangerous place when you re with an abuser because they have you isolated even in plain sight he wanted me away from the kid so he could say the thing to me he wouldn t say in front of them there wa also the control aspect of not allowing me to leave making it clear he wa in charge what he did there wa an unspoken rule about money i wasn t allowed to spend more than 200 without his approval and that 200 had to be grocery or clothes for the kid thing like that he wa allowed to purchase big ticket item like a motorcycle without even talking to me about it he would just announce that he wa buying whatever and i wasn t allowed to have a say in it why it s abuse this is financial abuse even though for most of our marriage i made nearly twice a much a much a he did i didn t have equal access or decision making ability with my own money it s all about control he framed it up a a division of duty the finance were his duty even though he rarely paid the bill on time and we had our gad water and electricity turned off many time when we had the fund he just couldn t be bothered to pay what he did he managed the bill to manage the money but he wouldn t have anything to do with the mail he refused to get it out of the mailbox i would bring it in and there wa no designated place for it then bill would get lost and he would blame me at one point i begged him to designate a space for the mail and he refused i bought bin and marked them for mail and they would overflow i would go through the mail and set the bill aside and he would get angry that i wa shoving them in his face i started putting them on his work desk and he complained that when he sat down to work they were in the way he worked from home frequently he once got really mad and told me he would now be getting all of the mail from the mailbox so i stopped he of course didn t for over a week and the mailbox overflowed so much the mailman started leaving mail on our porch why it s abuse control crazymaking something to blame me for this one made me nut and he knew it he intentionally wa difficult just to be difficult it lead to my feeling on inadequacy about organization and clutter now that i live on my own house i don t have this problem what he did he lost thing all the time all the time it wa always my fault because i couldn t keep the house clean and his stuff kept getting covered up since i moved out he ha had to replace all of the card in his wallet at least 3 time 3 that i know of over a year and a half because he keep losing his wallet but of course it wa always my fault before why it s abuse he blameshifted all over me because he couldn t handle the fact that he wa incompetent not that losing stuff make you incompetent but that how it made him feel and that wa incredibly uncomfortable for him so he shifted the blame to me using something i wa already insecure about organization and clutter what he did he refused to help me clean the house yet he left his thing scattered all over he complained about clutter all the time i would do a big clean and end up putting all of his thing in a box because i didn t know where he wanted them if i tried to put them away he would get mad that he couldn t find them there are still several of these box still in the basement to my knowledge he life in our marital home because he refused to deal with it why it s abuse he complained about clutter but wouldn t change his behavior to help instead i wa expected to change my behavior cleaning his mess he didn t have the problem i did what he did when other people would visit he made a production of helping them into the house and to their car carrying their bag even when it wa ridiculously comical when i came home from grocery shopping another duty left to me he would sit on the couch with his foot up and watch me make several trip to and from the car with heavy bag whenever i asked for his help he simply said no and refused to move why it s abuse his refusal to help me showed me that his time wa more important and i wasn t worth the effort to help in order to show me how low he regarded me he fell all over himself for everyone else there are many other example but this is already pretty long this give you an idea of the type of thing this type of abuser doe anyone could do one of these thing once in a while but it s the consistency and the number of thing that make it abusive a well a the purpose it s not just insensitive it s intentional to make the abused feel unloved and like they re going crazy while what he did wa wrong i do have compassion for him he genuinely belief this is how relationship work he tried he failed miserably but he tried he is incapable of love incapable of being happy and incapable of growth because of whatever trauma his parent put him through a a child that turned him into a narcissist because narcissist are made not born they did this to him i don t excuse his behavior and i most definitely no longer tolerate it when we met in college he wa full of ideal and we had dream those were slowly crushed with the reality of adulating to the point that he became a lump who spent his weekend sleeping on the couch the man i married turned into a loser and blamed me for it when he left me he rattled of a long list of thing i did that made his life miserable i m too loud i m too sensitive i don t like coffee i don t fall in line behind him i don t immediately defer to his parenting decision i read too much i don t make enough money i m a bad cook i m bad at cleaning the house it went on for over an hour people change life doesn t go a expected but the difference is how you respond his response wa to abuse me blame me for his failure refuse to meet my need refuse to help them blame me for not doing enough he ha no character men with character don t leave their wife of 17 year for a woman they had met just six month prior they don t treat the one person who love and support them like total garbage they don t throw temper tantrum when they don t get their way the good news is knowledge is power he doesn t know that i know he s an abusive narcissist it s my secret weapon loser like him are predictable once you crack their code they are so easy to read everything they do is because they need to win they need to have control and they need to make sure you know it the secret is to learn to become indifferent to his behavior attack i have had to learn to accept that he is never going to behave the way a normal person would he intentionally us confusing language and give me half of the fact in order to upset me in order to feel superior i don t take it personally because it s not about me it s about his wee widdle fragile ego,1
my father mid50s refused to help me pay for my mid20s plane ticket home for the holiday is it unfair for me to stop speaking to him over this i m 25 year old and moved across the country a year ago for law school i moved out a a teenager and put myself through undergrad and law school with a combination of job and student loan my parent are divorced my mother ha a middle class income and raised my two sibling alone my father ha an upper middle class income and dodged child support through fraud which i won t describe for anonymity reason neither of my parent have contributed to my education and i pay for my own living expense i have a job out here this upcoming summer and this winter might be the only chance i get to visit home for a long while but i ve been a hard up for cash and the round trip ticket home is over 1000 i had some unexpected expense come up over the past few month my laptop broke and i needed to replace it had to travel out of town for job interview etc and the idea of spending even more money is daunting my law school loan provides me with a decent amount of money for living expense tuition but that loan isn t free money it s money i have to pay back and money that i pay interest on every month i know my mother is broke from supporting my younger brother and sister who are both living with her while completing post secondary so i don t ask her for help instead i call my father and asked him if he could help pay for my ticket home i honestly expected him to say yes i never ask him for money he lived at home into his mid 20 and his parent bought him a house i figured he d be at least sympathetic but he tell me he absolutely won t help he say that i m lazy because i chose not to work this past summer and i shouldn t be asking for handout when i don t do anything to help myself he later call my mother to tell her that she shouldn t even want me to come home because i m a failure my dad pressured me into going to law school i went am getting good grade and it s still not enough feel like shit i realize i m a grown as adult and neither of my parent are obligated to give me any financial help and i know that ultimately the choice to go to law school wa my own nobody else is responsible for helping me handle the challenge associated with it but i m honestly just homesick and overwhelmed with debt i didn t work this past summer but i ve been working in school since i wa 14 and paying my own bill since i wa 17 my mother wa diagnosed with cancer right after i moved away last year she s cancer free now thankfully and i wanted to spend my summer at home with my friend family relaxing and recuperating from a nightmare year i still want to go home and see my family but i don t really see a point in continuing a relationship with my father he s expressed that he doesn t care whether i come home or not he s told me he never intends to visit me if i build a life out here despite the fact that he ha both the time and money to fly out here and honestly he s just been consistently awful over the year cheated on my mother repeatedly knocked out two of my baby teeth a a kid etc etc and this feel like a breaking point am i being petty and entitled if i just decide to cut all contact with my father tl dr i m currently putting myself through law school and want to visit home for the holiday money is a little tight right now and i asked my dad to help me pay for my ticket home he refused reamed me out for not having worked this past summer and proceeded to call my mother and tell her he doesn t care if i come home i m annoyed and want to cut all contact with him i know i m an adult and nobody else is responsible for taking care of my financial difficulty but he s never paid child support for my sibling and i i ve been supporting myself and putting myself through school since i wa 17 and he s generally just been awful to my sibling mother and i over the year am i being petty and entitled if i decide to just stop speaking to my father altogether,0

me 29f and my boyfriend 29m should i consider any of these a red flag i have been with this guy for about 4 month thing have progressed rather rapidly and we spend a lot of time together he s sweet funny nice and i love his family we also have a pretty great sex life for the most part but lately i ve been noticing some thing that i would consider to be red flag but i don t know if i m overreacting on thanksgiving we got home from his parent house and he wa incredibly drunk i wa tipsy but not nearly a drunk a him i wasn t interested in having sex because him being that drunk wa a turn off and i asked him if we could just go to bed we went back and forth and he just kept asking so i obliged to end the conversation so that i could go to sleep the next morning he apologized and admitted that he shouldn t do thing like that the next night i wanted to watch a movie and relax with him i wa actually really excited to watch the movie we chose he spent a lot of the time touching me and making it very clear he wanted to have sex i wa having a great time watching the movie and told him that i wanted to watch it but he continued to touch me and otherwise try to get me to have sex with him i told him again and he got upset and told me i might a well just wake him up when the movie ended that essentially ruined the night for me he did end up falling asleep but not before continuing to do thing to me to try to get me in the mood at that point i just ignored him last night wa kind of the final straw that snapped me into thinking maybe i m in a bad situation i had started my period and did not feel like having sex at all i told him this and he said he still wanted to do sexual thing and i told him i didn t want to he started jerking himself off and pulled my hand down to his nut because he like them played with i wa trying to pull my hand away but he just pulled a bit harder i had worked an overnight shift the night before and i wa just so tired that i relented i also kind of figured considering his response to any other refusal that it wouldn t matter what i said anyways he asked me at one point if it wa okay about 5 minute in and i said it wa which i realize is my fault it just seemed pointless to stop at that point since i had already started i guess what i m asking is if i m just being over dramatic he is otherwise so sweet and so nice to me he cook for me he s very attentive he plan date and we laugh together is this something i should take into serious consideration or just let it go a a one time thing he s never really exhibited this kind of behavior before tl dr boyfriend in new relationship crossed some boundary that make me think he might not be a nice and sweet a i imagined but i don t know if i m overreacting,0

friend charge money for drink and food whenever i m invited hello everyone this is my first post and i hope i m not breaking any rule i m not a native speaker so please excuse my mistake i f28 have two colleague f30 m32 who became good friend over the past 3 year that i ve known them both of them and their significant others a well a my partner and me occasionally meet up for game night usually this is at our place since it s in the middle of the other couple home whenever it is at our place we provide all the drink and snack we don t mind that we like having people around and never thought anything of it however whenever we are invited to either of the others unless it s a birthday they bring out the bill to split for the drink and the food they bought i normally bring something to those event for example dessert for everyone however i m still paying for the expense of the host i m getting really frustrated about this i feel like we re all adult now we all work and make decent money and if you invite someone you should not charge them if it were always at the same person s home i would get the idea but i think if you take turn inviting each other it always end up sort of even we have not once charged them and we have been at our place the most i do not want to start charging them money when we meet at our place that s not an option for me however i would like to approach this somehow since it make me uncomfortable doe anyone have any advice on how to phrase that i no longer want to pay for food and drink when i m invited i don t want to make too big of a deal of it because those are people that i otherwise like a lot and also work with or am i being unreasonable and this practice is more common than i know tl dr how can i nicely tell my friend that i don t like the idea to split the bill when we spend time at their house,0

how i ended up in an abusive relationship i had a very unusual childhood i am the only girl with a lot of older brother one of whom i now realize is most likely a sociopath while i wa a child he used to love to torment me he used to say you used to just make me mad all the time by just being around and i don t know why he also used to regularly do thing like hold a pillow over my face or repeatedly hold me under water or lock me in a pitch black closet if he walked by and there wa no one around who could punish him i usually ended up on the floor i often thought he might kill me by accident my parent still don t know the degree to which he wa abusing me because my brother wa incredibly smart about it and i knew i d get it worse if i told it wa terrifying but i wa good at fighting back my childhood wa practically battle training i got incredibly good at suppressing pain and fear and finding any way to inflict whatever damage on him that i could i know it s weird but sometimes it wa actually fun for me sometimes the rush of getting the best of someone who is much bigger and stronger than you can be pretty exciting but i m starting to realize how this messed me up i wa blocking out the abuse and reveling in those momentary win which were pretty few and far between so i left home for college battle trained but there wa no one to fight anymore i think i actually missed the abuse in some way i ve heard soldier long to come home but they often miss the war i think i can relate in some way i wa great at manipulating and exerting power over people and it gave me such a rush but i would never do that to someone who wasn t trying to harm me when it wa time for me to start dating i found most of the guy to be really boring until i found someone who wa abusive for me the push and pull of that power dynamic wa like a drug like any good drug it eventually started destroying me i m a few year out of that relationship now and i m in a very healthy one after 25 year of abuse i ve finally learned what a truly loving relationship look like and i can reflect back on how i ended up where i did i wish none of this happened to me but it did i got some very specific skill out of it and i m trying to figure out how they apply to a normal healthier life idk what point i m getting to just sharing my thought i guess,1

my 26f husband 25 m gorge on food and ha absolutely no care for his diet okay so when i met my husband he wa a bit chubby he went from being rail thin a a teenager to probably overweight because he moved out of home and ate a lot and lot of high calorie food he is extremely tall a well so he can kind of pull it off shortly after we were together he lost a lot of weight just because i prefer to cook rather than get takeaway and also co we were having a lot of sex since then understandably we have both gained a bit of weight i had gotten slightly overweight but actually that s because i have pcos medical condition i do tend to try to keep myself healthy in spite of my condition so i worked hard on my diet exercise and lost the weight and now i am a healthy weight again but want to get to a more ideal weight i have a sensitive digestive system and care a lot about health so do not tend to eat junk food and try to stay low sugar etc my husband ha started to really not care about his weight or body and he s getting really doughy he doe not care at all about sugar consumption he put an obscene amount of sugar in his coffee and doe not care at all to reduce it he eats a ridiculous amount of food and basically gorge himself if he ha an option he will eat very high calorie junk food i understand he is a tall man and need to eat a lot more than me but i know for a fact he binge eats and gorge himself even for his size today he ate probably estimated 2400 calorie in nacho and other high calorie food on top of that i believe we should look after our body especially when we are young because it will make a difference when we are older when i tell how unhealthy his habit are he doesn t show any care about it he even say yeah i want to gain weight and when he weighs himself and actually loses weight he get upset and say i need to gain weight his reasoning for this is supposedly he is trying to bulk up however he doesn t go to the gym at all he ha a membership but ha been to the gym three time in two year just wasting our money personally i can t help that i find it unattractive if he wa chubby and eating a reasonable amount of healthy food i wouldn t judge him at all but someone gorging themselves without a care and basically destroying their body is very unattractive to me i am le attracted to him when he is getting fat but if it wa outside his control i wouldn t judge him it s just that he is doing on purpose i find it repelling i feel also he doesn t care about whether or not i am attracted to him personally i want to look good for him mostly for myself but i do feel partner should try to maintain a certain standard rather than let themselves go i feel he doesn t care about that at all yes there are a few other thing i don t like but this is one of the big one i feel like if he did this before we got married i would never have marries him i don t want to control him i wish he just cared about his health again i don t care if he isn t very health conscious like me i just want him to stop completely gorging himself and trying to gain weight on purpose what should i do about it tl dr husband gorge himself binge eats doe not care about his diet and purposely try to gain weight i find this attitude incredibly unattractive and i wish he would stop what should i do,0

my father 57 m is a doctor and he almost killed me 18f by medical malpractice when i wa 15 i m disabled because of it i refuse to speak to him now wish i could sue him wish he were dead what do i do to preface i ll say that i understand my dad care about and love me he didn t mean to hurt me yet it happened he s always been a bit reckless risk taking when it come to everything in life and ha had a tendency to overlook detail which ha landed our family in trouble multiple time in his field of medicine not emergency it doesn t really matter but his recklessness almost killed me a a result i am still having severe health problem to this day and partially disabled basically i can t forgive him for what he did and i absolutely hate his gut for making such an idiotic mistake detail since age 12 i had pretty bad cystic acne not the most severe ever and it bothered me but not to the point where i wa horrifically depressed it brought me down made me feel bad about myself i did multiple round of antibiotic cream etc i even tried to research into diet change but my dad being a doctor ridiculed me for this and said don t be foolish there s no proof diet cause acne by age 15 my dad wa heavily pushing for me to go on accutane a really intense drug for acne i d never heard of it at the time i wa basically a kid i researched it a little and it sounded sorta scary i told my dad i wa scared but he reassured me it s super safe showed me all these study saying it wa safe told me my cousin took it and that if i wanted to feel better i should take it too i think maybe he wa tired of me complaining and feeling down and just wanted to shut me up with something he thought would work since i wa going crazy trying all sort of home remedy and diet basically he didn t want to go through all the hassle of ipledge and waiting and etc and since he thought accutane wa no big deal he got some leftover accutane from a son s friend who no longer needed it and decided to give it to me under his supervision he ha always been very tight on budget despite being a doctor that s how he wa raised always trying to cut corner and save money he calculated that it would be cheaper for him to order me monthly blood panel himself and get the free leftover medication than to do the monthly office visit and pay for the medication his friend s son wa on a super high dose of like 120mg and he thought we d just do a low dose of 20mg so a month s supply would last me 6 month so i started accutane everything wa fine at first but in the 3rd month i started feeling really off i wa having a hard time with memorizing thing and just felt really angry and depressed i asked my dad if it were the accutane and he said no accutane doesn t cause memory issue and he referred me to a psychiatrist who put me on antidepressant i just kept feeling worse i started getting into argument and fight and my dad kept telling me it wasn t the accutane i started having pain in my knee and my dad told me it wasn t the accutane finally i decided to stop taking it because it wa making me miserable a few month after stopping it i started having really bad pain in my kidney then i started having a hard time walking i wa falling over and losing coordination i developed severe headache i developed pressure in my head severe pain throughout my body ibs horrific neuropathy cracking in all my joint terrible terrible brain fog i started having seizure and had period of time where i became catatonic i even became partially paralyzed due to the neuropathy and wasn t able to walk for week at a time the pain level were like 8 10 and i just couldn t move i researched on the internet and found out that it wa the accutane that caused me to be so sick other people were having the same thing my dad took me to different specialist and doctor who told me that the illness wa all in my head and that basically i wa making it up for attention i showed him what i found online about accutane and he told me it wa all complete nonsense that accutane can t have caused my health issue at all he threatened me and said that if i didn t stop reading internet blog that he d stop paying for my medical bill and my food it s been 3 year i have been deathly ill since i wa 15 i had to drop out of school because i can barely walk more than a few hundred foot and i am struggling to pas with homeschooling because my headache are so bad i wa a straight a student before my dad continues to blame me for my health problem i will have to go on disability a my parent are kicking me out of the house and i m not well enough to work or go to college i recently found out that in addition to all my other severe health issue my kidney function is dangerously low i have the kidney of a 90 year old my doctor noted that this wa unusual she suspected that accutane had damaged my kidney i looked back at my blood lab my dad ordered when i took accutane 3 year ago and sure enough my kidney function had dropped during treatment my gfr went down dramatically while on it cpk elevated cholesterol sky rocked this wa all clear evidence that the drug wa damaging me and my father who looked at my blood lab obviously had no idea what he wa doing and told me that everything looked perfect even though my kidney were becoming damaged progressively with my kidney function so low it s likely i ll have to go on dialysis within the next 10 year or so i am disabled in horrible agonizing pain constanty and have lost my entire life over what my dad did to me my dad still doesn t think that the drug injured me and think that my kidney function being lower is idiopathic fancy doctor term for random without known cause he refuse to accept responsibility for what happened to me he tell me that he love me and he s sorry that i m not well and he want to help he said that all he ever wanted to do is help me i tell him to fuck off that i don t care and want nothing to do with him i ve looked into lawyer and lawsuit over this but so far each lawyer ha refused my case since basically my medical record don t prove that i ever took accutane there s no way to prove that he even gave it to me at all it s all under the table a if nothing ever happened but i know that it did i am shattered there isn t any cure it s not just my kidney that have been damaged it s my eye joint muscle bone nerve brain even hair there s nothing that this accutane poisoning didn t do to me i dreamt of being the perfect daughter making my parent proud becoming a lawyer falling in love having a family instead all i can do is curl up in a ball all day in pain wishing to die in my sleep since the torture is neverending i told my dad that he is a disgusting human being a piece of shit father a pathetic doctor and that i wished he d do me a favor and just die i refuse to speak to him i never want to see him again and i will not forgive him i told him that i don t care if what he did wa out of good intention because his idiocracy literally killed me it unforgivable i told him that if i could sue him for 100 of his saving and asset leaving him with nothing i absolutely would in a heartbeat but i can t my family tell me that i should forgive him that i m being mean and too harsh to him that it wa a mistake and he didn t mean it but he ha a hard time admitting to mistake yea well this mistake wa incredibly dangerous and it killed me tl dr my well intentioned but idiotic physician father made a horrific negligent error by prescribing a dangerous acne drug to me despite having no clue what he wa doing didn t properly read my blood lab now i have damage in my kidney and most organ of my body leading to disability he refuse to acknowledge that the drug hurt me despite being previously healthy and having lab to prove it i told my dad i want him dead and that if i could sue him for 100 of his worth i d do it but i can t my family say i m being harsh on him an asshole also that it s my fault what should i do,0

my fiancé 25m ha a blood type that is impossible based on his parent blood type i 25f am the only one who know this this happened within the last two week title say it all i m a geneticist and my fiancé wa recently interested in what his blood type wa his parent are avid donor so i told him to ask what theirs wa and i could give him an idea of what his would be they both sent picture of their donor card with their blood type on it i did a punnet square and give him 2 outcome wanting to know for sure he had the doctor type him at his most recent appointment the blood type the doctor gave him is impossible based on his parent to double check i made a date day of giving and we went to give blood together and while we were they i asked them to type u and give u card same blood type a the doctor gave him being a geneticist i have always been an advocate of doing 23andme for the health report three year ago when we got together i did mine for a class and being that we ve talked about kid more recently i told my fiancé he should do one too he is cool with it and excited to see the report his mom ha always talked about how she isn t sure of her ancestry so i mentioned we got him one and asked if she wanted to order a well and she wa very against it because she didn t want the government to have her data now i m not sure if she is aware of something and doesn t want anyone finding out or if she truly feel that way she didn t seem to know that blood type are able to be figured out by genetics the whole 23andme thing happened slightly before the blood typing and his sample ha been submitted so we re waiting on the result when my fiancé asked why he didn t have the type i told him he would have i simply told him that i messed up and crossed them the wrong way he doesn t know how to do the square so he shrugged it off and went about his day now i m in quite a pickle with what to do i ve stumbled upon business that clearly isn t mine to know however if i ever found out that my fiancé knew something like this and didn t tell me i would feel so betrayed he submitted his 23andme sample already and now i m at a crossroad of what to do because while it s unlikely it s possible that relative may come back on his report and they won t be people he know at this point i feel i only have a couple option and none of them sound great talk to his mom first since she would know most about it and let her talk to him talk to him first and let him approach his parent about it don t tell him at all and risk a relative of his that he doesn t know showing up on 23andme and also letting him continue to falsely assume he know his genetic family medical history a we venture down the path of child and growing old any insight would be appreciated my last resort is not telling him it s making me sick to hide this from him and i know if this were reversed and i were to find out i would feel like everyone im closest to is suddenly hard to trust tldr fiancés blood type isn t possible based on his parent blood type i m the only one who know this based on genetics 23andme sample wa submitted before this info wa stumbled upon and were waiting on result of 23andme at a crossroad of what to do with this info a relative he may not know could show up and he will wonder why i don t want to hide this from him for the rest of our life,0

a classic conversation between me and my ex ,1
abusive relationship i ve decided to share my story and where i am right now to help me not only with clarity but the decision i am facing i ve been dating my now fiance for about 3 year i am blindly in love with her it all started after around 6 7 month in when she would get physical with me because something didn t go her way by physical i mean punching me throwing thing at me and even strangling me i m about 5 8 and shes 5 2 so no real harm done i thought she would after apologize and we would talk it out eventually this kept happening again and again once every 4 5 week and it always came down to a few trigger that she didn t like mostly to do with my family now i wa so in love i kept thinking to myself that i m not actually getting hurt and she doesn t mean it at all all in all the physical abuse ha happened around a dozen time also i should mention is that she is pretty ocd i get shouted at if i used the wrong towel didn t organize the clothes properly to dry didn t wipe down the sink etc and quite controlling she would sometimes ask me what to wear if i wa late call me 10 time etc she also tends to guilt me if i wa to tell her i would go out to see friend football she d threaten to break up with me say i didn t love her etc even though these are also wrong of her lately she ha gotten much better now every time she would have an episode she would say shes sorry i d forgive and her and we d move on she really doe love me and i know sometimes she can t control herself she even say herself she is obsessed with me and that s why she act this way and so every time i forgive her and we move on unfortunately her physical episode only seemed to get worst until eventually she threw something at me quite hard on my head and literally wa strangling me and squeezing which in itself is quite traumatizing when she ha these episode i always try to calm her but she pretty much black out and whatever she see in front of her she blindly throw and punch me this time though thankfully it wasn t glass but a tin of her body lotion she wa also hitting me hard enough to definitely cause a black eye or even knock me out if i hadn t protected myself at this point i freaked and left the house and wa done with her i wa not only so angry at her but also scared if she act this way with me how will she act with our child but once again i feel bad for her and i know it not coming from a bad place when i got back we talked a lot and agreed she will go to therapy to try and figure out why she keep doing this to me however i told her this wa the last time if she ever got physical with me again i will pack my thing and leave her there is never an excuse to literally strangle or throw dangerous object to the person you supposedly love i am still angry with her and she know i am but her willingness to take this step is i believe the correct and healthy one for both our sake and the relationship if anybody ha gone through a similar relationship please share so we discus thanks,1

i need some advice my gf 18 and i 20 have been dating just under 6 month now the week before we started dating she asked me to be her boyfriend i wa leaving for a vacation and wasn t positive if i trusted her enough to take thing to that level i ve been fucked over a few time so i said i d answer when i get back in a week to see how she act when i m not around i remember specifically saying to her before i left that this week wa a sort of test run we keep in touch the whole week thing are great i tell my family about her however a coworker of ours f call me one night and hand my gf the phone she s extremely intoxicated asking if it s okay for her to sleep with girl and asks me permission to sleep with the girl who called me this made me contemplate wether she would stay faithful in the future but i get back and decide to be with her regardless fast forward 2 month into our relationship i gain the knowledge that a few day before we started dating while i wa on vacation she got drink with a different coworker of ours m and ended up going back to his place and having oral sex she deliberately hid it from me because she knew i wouldn t have started dating her now she rationalizes it by saying we weren t exclusive because i found out 2 month in i wa already invested in her and unable to break up however i am still having trouble trusting her and it is leading to difficulty in our relationship any advice,1
recovery is not what i expected some thing you may experience after abuse what i expected v reality 1 to feel relieved i had felt unsafe and spent so long watching my word and action so a not to piss him off i honestly expected to feel relieved and free what i actually felt desperate scared and more alone than i have ever experienced even many month later i have yet to feel relief 2 anger if it had been a friend or family member in my situation i would have been furious at how they were treated i expected once the fog of the relationship cleared i would be pissed at being treated like le than human what i actually felt i spent a lot of time questioning my own action i reevaluated our fight and obsessed over what i could have done differently 3 hate i feel like at some point i should hate him for being such an as for being so unbothered by all the hurt i wa put through what i actually felt sad i am worth being treated well it took time for me to refund my self confidence and self worth i am deserving of love yet i still feel sad for my younger self for the relationship a it wa at beginning for the loss of someone i thought wa the one 4 finally i expected surprise from others when i finally confided in them about the abuse what actually happened the people i am close to weren t surprised they saw him more clearly than i ever did tl dr leaving an abusive relationship wa not in any way what i expected it wa still worth it i stood up for myself and my own safety i don t regret it,1

my 28f boyfriend 30m is cheap and his hand are constantly dirty tl dr not sure if bf is filthy and cheap or if what he is doing make sense i am dating a man who work in i t yet his hand are always filthy he get a bath everyday and wear glove when he work on thing around the house but it is like his hand are permanently stained from grease if he ever go to an event like a wedding he ha to scrub and scrub on his hand with aa green scour pad to clean up his hand which i think is actually just removing the dirty skin at the surface he wash his hand a he work but in some case the grim just never seems to go away after the work the first day he will also wear all of his clothing for year until it wear out while working on a plumbing job about 2 year ago he wa walking though our town and a homeless person thought he wa also homeless and took him to a shelter and got him a coat which he accepted and still wear he doe have clothes for work which he doe not dirty but they are also ancient some belonged to his late grandfather they are not in disrepair but they do look worn out he agreed to clean out some of the worse clothing but he ha said his intended policy on clothing is he keep something until it is down to about 60 capacity so if his old jean have rip or hole he doesnt get rid of them until they are long past the point of anyone else getting rid of them he keep everything past the point i would personally get rid of it he wa putting an alternator in his car last year a diesel beetle with 280k mile on it and his argument wa that even with replacement part totaling a few hundred a year and spending the time to do it himself it make more financial sense to keep his older car until it is completely done or so expensive to fix that he would get rid of it he did break down and bought a replacement vehicle this year it is the same model vehicle one year newer with about half the mile on it he intends to repair the engine on the old one and give it to a friend daughter for her 16th is he being cheap and unreasonable in how he life,0
my 24f mother 59f hostile towards me for getting a divorce and she went through my phone my 24f mother 59f treating me horribly for getting a divorce and went through my phone i come from a quite traditional christian family in the southern u prayer before every meal and bed sexist racist homophobic joke constantly parent went to 2016 trump inauguration middle child of 7 sibling parent still married i started dating my soon to be ex husband when i wa 16 and he wa 17 in high school got married in 2018 my older brother is also married to his high school sweetheart and all of my sibling excluding my mentally handicapped oldest brother have long term significant others my mom s dream is for none of her child to move away and for her to buy a massive plot of land where we all build house with our own family quite culty i ve always been the black sheep vegetarian raging liberal non religious outspoken woman many instance of solely and timidly calling out intolerant comment joke my dad ha made through the year the realization of double standard and toxic behavior in my life started happening the beginning of 2019 and that eventually seeped into my relationship with my husband i won t go into too many detail about that relationship although i could it basically wa very one sided and my struggle and opinion never held the same weight a his there were year of numerous manipulative tactic against me including him being suicidal and putting the responsibility of keeping him alive on me when i wa becoming unhappy he threatened to quit his job and disappear amongst other fucked up thing out of fear he would kill himself with any move i took i went through an extensive process of moving out and included him in everything i told him numerous time i wa unhappy started sleeping in another room then said i wanted to move somewhere else then when i wa looking at apartment then when i found one then my move in date he didn t say anything to any of these step no response at all general apathy i feel like this is pretty obviously a good move for me to end this relationship however my family is treating me otherwise i have distanced myself from my family a much a possible during this out of lack of trust and other toxic behavior i have realized with them my parent have been quite upset about this distance they want to do dinner every single weekend at least my mom hasn t reached out to me at all the last 4 month when i have seen her she won t look me in the eye my older sister told me my mom wa upset with me and telling her about it and that pissed me off since she won t even try talking to me i called her that same day after work and asked what the issue is she played dumb initially but soon the convo turned into the meanest thing she ha ever said to me she told me because i don t reach out even though they don t either i wouldn t care if they dropped dead this wa after i told her month before about my husband using suicide against me she also said i must not care about any of them my sister is a senior in h and she need me even though my sister hasn t said anything and i can guarantee my mom isn t placing the same expectation on my brother she asked me if i had friend to hang out with and i wa proud to say i had made new friend in this hard time in my life and she said she hope they make me happy since my family apparently doesn t she asked what i do on the night i m not there with them and i told her some thing like cleaning or taking new class etc she responded with so i guess you d rather be doing that than spending time with your family i wa sobbing during this and wa openly saying mom you re hurting my feeling mom you re being manipulative mom you are being mean and she would ignore it and continue to try to upset me she also wa getting angry that i didn t have a plan because i hadn t precisely laid out a plan for divorce my apartment next year etc i also found out she had been going through my phone since we are on the same phone plan and had been tracking my location she made up a very obvious lie but later admitted she did i don t know exactly what she went through but it wa a complete invasion of privacy especially since that wa her first move instead of contacting me and seeing what i m up to i think most of this is stemming from her own issue she is quite oppressed by my dad and i m not allowed to be leaving my husband and living alone although none of them would ever openly admit that i also want to note i have a bachelor s degree in mechanical engineering i have a full time job i am financially independent from them and able to support myself when my husband and i split i think i have very much proved myself a an adult and i continue to be treated like a child from essentially everyone in my life the point of this post is partially to vent phew but i mainly wanted advice i truly don t know where to go from here my mom hasn t reached out since other than a text that night after being on the phone saying she s sorry i m going through stuff and she s sorry she can t be the one to help me which i never said the holiday are coming up and i haven t been home or talked to most of my sibling in month i know i have some power here to decide what the dynamic of these relationship are going forward but i have no desire to speak to any of them but i don t want to be permanently burning bridge either i have always wanted to move away from home no one in my family ha and it s becoming more and more intriguing my initial thought is to just go through the motion whenever necessary like thanksgiving and christmas but i don t know what to do any help would be appreciated tl dr after separating from a toxic relationship with my husband and month without my mom reaching out she wa really mean to me about not part of the culty family unit anymore and admitted to tracking my location,0

stepdad take car i paid for possibly leaving me financially crippled okay for context i 18f bought a car when i wa working at a fast food joint after saving up enough money however in my family you give 1 3 of the price of the car you are going to buy cannot be a car over 6000 to my parent before the purchase i contributed a little under 2000 a we sorted out a deal because my stepdad needed me to purchase a gift for my mother for him a he wa low on money that would cover the extra cost leftover said stepdad m48 ha now decided a car is under his name because we were required to put it under his name in order to get the car that the car is actually his and not mine so im no longer able to drive it or make any decision on whether it is sold or not he ha recently been taking my key to the car and claiming that it is his because he paid most of it keep in mind i have two older sister both f 19 that have contributed the same amount but are able to own their car a they are still living at home and are staying at home to do uni however im moving to sydney in january and had to borrow some money to put a deposit down that we decided would come out of the sale price of my car a im selling it to move to a city though i hadn t planned to sell it so early and my step father ha taken full control over the car and claim i cannot get any money from it im not quite sure how i can get the money but if i don t get it i won t be able to afford rent a i had planned to rely on the money for rent for the first couple of week while i wa working a i wasn t allowed a job whilst living with them but that s a story for another time so i could both afford rent and to go to uni but if the car is sold and i am given no money i will most likely have to stay with my family and not go to that uni a it is 4 hour away though it is the only uni that offer the course i want doe anyone have any suggestion tldr stepdad take car possibly leaving me unable to afford uni any advice would be fantastic,0

i feel like i ll always blame myself i made a recent post about an ex that brought up the memory of a different one my first boyfriend he wa emotionally abusive he would ghost me for day week at a time and my best friend hereby known a bf would tell me that it wa because my boyfriend wa just busy with work he would tell me how much he missed me when he came back but he wouldn t be affectionate towards me unless he noticed how rejected that it wa making me feel then that s when he would kiss me or hug me sometimes he would hold my hand he always talked about how beautiful bf is he made it known that he loved how much her breast are bigger then mine he loved how her as is bigger then mine and he loved how much more talented she is then me i m slow at time with thing but i noticed i confronted him but he told me that he admired her a a friend and that i wouldn t know because i don t have friend that wa true they where my only friend i gave him that victory he broke up with me for hugging one of our male friend he called me a cheating slut but he got back with me after a day of silence because he missed me i got back with him because i grew up in a household where dad always divorced mom but they always got back together i grew up hearing how in love they are he would often score lap dance from bf she would often let him watch her shower and he would often give her massage i confronted them all the time but they always used it against me that i have no idea of what s normal because ex wa my first boyfriend and she wa my first real friend i once again gave up dad did the same thing too to mom so i thought that maybe that wa normal for relationship the final straw for me wasn t him playing with my emotion or them playing with my perception it wa when ex and bf ghosted me for a month when they finally talked to me again they talked about how much they ve fucked in their new house that they bought together how they got engaged during their time away they made me seem crazy for being upset because he didn t even break up with me before they ran off i blocked them both after that it s been year since then and i don t know nor do i care if their still together i m with a great man now he s my love and my world he s actually deserving of being called a man when i reminisce with him about the past the guilt always come back i feel guilty sometimes that i let ex s and bf s abusive go on like that when the red flag where headlight coming towards me and i just stood there,1
kicking myself for wishing him well in my goodbye message 11 day ago i left my narc bf after two year of abuse one thing that wa constant in his many manipulative way wa that he d randomly express relationship doubt and have me cry over him because of the discard he did this again 4 month ago expressing the doubt but in the most persistent way yet 3 out of those 4 month wa him breadcrumbing me and wasting my time to have a talk that he wa dragging his foot on i realize now that he wa gearing up for the final discard fortunately i began to outwardly express my detachment to him during those month and i beat him to it but i keep re reading the message a being too nice it wa detached which im proud of but i should have went off and told him he never loved me or cared about me he s just gonna think that i think he took me for granted hell i told him i wish him well wtf it come across a so weak and nice to me sigh at that point i owned up to the fact that i wa being abused but until 2 day after i sent it did i start having the real memory of the sheer torture that went on and i got so angry and wanted to send him another message to inform him of the severity of his abuse but i didnt my final message read hi i just want to let you know that i wont be using this e mail address after today i have focused a lot of my energy on the outcome of will it or wont it in term of whatever it is we are doing and a large part of that ha been waiting for a conversation that i never received when i asked or ha been up in the air i choose to no longer do that i realized a lot over the last few month and realize what is best for me i will be putting my energy in myself and put myself first because i will always have my back i will always listen to myself and never take myself for granted and i will be doing so by myself ie a a single person i am no longer going to wait i choose me i wish you well advicewhatz,1
looking for perspective about a difficult and possibly abusive relationship m22 hello i m sorry if any aspect of this post isn t done correctly this is my first reddit post and i m using a throwaway account this post warrant a strong trigger warning for survivor of sexual assault and abusive relationship i have never known how to talk about this other than with a medical professional or with close friend and i feel the need to hear the perspective of people who have been affected by these issue i encourage people to be honest and critical if anyone wish to respond when i wa 17 18 year old i wa in relationship with a girl i met in high school we were the same age and met through mutual friend the relationship lasted about 13 month and wa generally a happy trusting and rewarding relationship but after we both started university a month after we had each turned 18 the relationship fell apart and quickly ended i handled the breakup terribly initially it wa amicable between u and we agreed to go to concert together with ticket we had bought while still in the relationship but a i started to feel regret for breaking up with her i told her i missed her and had made a mistake by breaking up with her i wa completely insensitive to her feeling she had moved on and wa happily beginning a new relationship i wa apologising to make myself feel better not out of respect or good will towards her from there the situation worsened and we started to argue about how unhappy we had been in the relationship and everything came to the surface we met up in a cafe to try and smooth thing over but instead she ended up telling me that i had sexually assaulted her during our relationship the implication wa that i had raped her though she stopped short of using that word my initial reaction wa shock but not denial i simply hadn t thought about it i wa caught off guard and wa in no position to dispute her so i told her that if it wa true she ought to tell people that she could trust and turn to the police if she felt it wa necessary understandably she said she didn t want to be seen a a victim but had managed to speak to some of her friend about it i suggested that we no longer have any contact with each other and that wa the end of that the question i have for this subreddit concern the incident itself i d like to know if people have the same assessment a my ex if i did in fact commit sexual assault i would like to reiterate the strong trigger warning for this post a i will describe the incident in detail below the incident in question about wa the last time we had sex together a week or two before the end of our relationship i had tried to initiate anal sex with her something we had done before had spoken about and were both comfortable with but she said no and placed her hand on my hip a if to say don t do that i understood and stopped immediately i assumed she wa referring specifically to that sex act and went to initiate vaginal sex instead her reaction wa different a her body language returned to normal she seemed relaxed she wa actively participating and she didn t reiterate any verbal or non verbal cue from before in retrospect i realise i made at least two mistake here i assumed that her first verbal cue no wa in relation to that specific act and not in relation to the general act of having sex my second mistake wa not seeking verbal consent after non verbal consent had previously been given with that in mind i understand why she described the incident a abusive even if she declined to call it rape some context that i feel is necessary to share is that early on in the relationship my ex had asked me to be dominating during sex she had asked to be choked and spanked and had directly asked me to continue having sex with her even if she told me to stop she reiterated the latter point more than once i wa never especially comfortable with this it s not something that appeal to me but i wanted to make her happy so we allowed ourselves to develop a sexual relationship that became very irresponsible with no established safe word or parameter i n this regard i see three further mistake on my part consenting to a sexual relationship that made me uncomfortable failing to set safe word and limit to the relationship and failing to educate myself about sexual consent in dom sub relationship since my ex partner spoke to me about this i have struggled to wrap my head around it thinking about this over the last few year ha been really tough and i ve been depressed and suicidal at time i wish i had been smarter and more empathetic but i also consider if that s how i feel how on earth doe she feel i can t imagine and it s a heartbreaking thought a expressed we are no lon ger in contact and haven t spoken in about 4 year i take full responsibility for my role in this and i know at the very least that i mistreated her during our relationship for the reason i ve mentioned above i loved her while we were together i always treated her the best i could and i still think of her and our relationship fondly but these mistake loom very large i would be very grateful to hear what anyone ha to say about this and i m more than happy to answer question i m sorry if this post cause anyone distress upset or trauma it truly isn t my intention if this is not an appropriate place for me to share this experience please let me know and i will take it down immediately,1

my 29 f husband 31 m is pushing me to find a hustle but that s not the way i operate and it s driving me away hey guy using a throwaway because my husband us reddit a well my husband and i got married 2 month ago after a long distance relationship we re compatible in mostly every way except the following for background i ve worked since the legal age where i wa from 14 in canada and have held down a job since i paid my way through school bought my own car and everything in between i have a degree in marketing and wa decently successful in my opinion my husband is from the usa and i moved here after our wedding whilst waiting out my green card process this mean that i cannot legally work until i have my green card a i don t have a ssn i have tried to find some odd job just to get out of the house and socialize ex dog walking most place require a ssn and i haven t been successful finding anything when i moved here it wa the first time i had lived outside my family home and i went from a small city in canada to quite a large one in the united state i knew coming in that i would need an adjustment period because i know i don t deal with change well and i told my husband this he agreed that i would definitely need an adjustment period once i got here i felt overwhelmed and a bit lost i didn t quite know what to do with myself coming from working full time and having a full life in my home city to now having only my husband and not a whole lot to do i volunteer to feel productive and i keep our house spotless and have dinner ready every evening however and here is where the problem lie my husband want me to be a hustler he doesn t want me to get a job once my green card come in he want me to create small business and run them and work on hustle and hustle only i m artistic and enjoy making art in my wind down time to relax my mind but he want me to monetize it i m open to that but he put this intense pressure on me to do it and do it now art ha always been just a past time for me that i enjoy doing but he s sucking the joy out of creating for me when i make something he critique it or tell me what i should be making instead he want me to design thing for his t shirt idea but when i do it s never exactly what he ha in his mind and he get grumpy that i m not creating correctly when i wa planning our wedding we hired a photobooth and i saw how much money they were making v how much work it wa to run it and i thought it wa a great side income to think about i posed it to him and he thought it wa great and wanted to buy one i did all the research for running it in the new city and had a solid marketing plan in mind when it came down to buying and starting it my husband kept evading the topic and so finally i dropped it i ve lived here for 2 month and just went back home for a quick trip and came back refreshed and ready to put my nose to the ground and start putting serious thought into how to make some money but every second day my husband want to sit down for a serious talk about why i haven t come up with a hustle i don t feel like i can come up with something out of thin air when i ask for input or advice he get frustrated and moody that he need to hold my hand through everything i need to want to do it for it to be successful he want me to do put my hand in multiple pot and do a lot of everything whereas i believe if i m going to do something i need to do that and do it well he constantly say it s not about me having an income and he doesn t care about the money but then his tone when talking about not finding my hustle yet ha undercurrent of why aren t you contributing financially i want to contribute financially and we are close to finishing the green card process and i will be able to get a job once that happens but he doe not want me to get a regular job i want to to have a stable income because stability is very important to me i am open to having a side hustle to bring in extra income but i don t want to do something just for the sake of saying i m hustling which is what he want me to do this is honestly completely driving me away from my husband because every serious talk make me feel like a complete failure and like i don t have drive or potential or talent i ve always worked hard and wa successful in my life before moving here but this ha put so much doubt in my mind and ha greatly affected my self confidence today wa the last straw for me when he sat me down for yet another serious talk when we just had one 2 night ago i told him then that i had some idea that i wa working on which i wa about to right before he sat me down for the talk and he said that it s not his fault he didn t remember the conversation because you know i have a short term memory this is such a cop out to me and constantly bringing it up when i think we ve laid the issue to rest because he can t seem to remember the conversation from 2 night prior is what is really starting to grate on me it s like micromanaging and breathing down my neck with no space to breathe get accustomed to my new surroundings and while finding this hustle he so greatly want me to find he is constantly reading those instagram inspiration business page that talk about start a business for under 250 and if you are making excuse you re not passionate enough and secret 2 success account and i feel like that s where all this stem from i ve lived here for two month and i think it wa fair for me to take a little time to adjust to 1 living together for the first time we were ldr 2 living in a new place and new country altogether and out of my parent home and on my own for the first time 3 build our home from scratch we had absolutely nothing except 1 bed and i wanted to get at least the basic together to make it somewhat of a home so we could be comfortable in our space he didn t give me space to breathe during that entire time even though i had made it clear before moving that i would need it and he agreed and even when i would bring it up during that time he would not back off if you ve stuck around reading all that mind ramble thank you and please share your thought and insight on this situation maybe i am missing something but this is beginning to make me resent him so much that sometimes i regret moving here and not just waiting out my green card process in canada tl dr my husband want me to be a hustler and expects me to create a hustle out of thin air not giving me time to adjust to living in a new country and is driving me away,0
my wife 30 is very controlling but ha threatened divorce what should i do tl dr my wife try to control so many aspect of my day to day life and is constantly criticizing me claiming that i need to change or she will divorce me what can i do please note this is the adjusted version of a previous question that i have reposted to be in compliance with site rule my wife and i both 30 have been married for about 5 month now and it s been rocky to say the least a month after the wedding she wanted to divorce me because i wasn t up to her standard her word she claim i m slobbish out of her league have no desire for personal growth and am not proactive enough in my life i practically begged her to continue the relationship saying i would do my best to change a far a i m concerned we just have two very different person personality and upbringing i m quite relaxed about my personal life since i work a stressful job a a senior manager in a major tech company and look at my home life a a bit of a sanctuary that said i cook frequently every other day clean take care of the dog do the laundry manage the finance etc in my eye i m a successful person with fault but a desire to grow but at my own pace i find my wife to be quite controlling and she feel the need to constantly comment and critique every aspect of me the way i dress what i eat when i eat my table manner when i go to bed when i wake up how i take care of the dog the way i load the dishwasher the way i do my laundry and so on it seems that there s only one way to do thing and it s not mine when i m finished eating she adjusts my fork and knife so that they are positioned the way she want them it s an etiquette thing she guilt me every night to go to bed by a certain time she grab my waistline and comment on my weight even though i m in pretty good shape she expects me to get a haircut that she like sending me photo of what she want and then get angry when the barber doesn t leave enough length she shame me every time i reach for a snack that s not carrot she tell me to take out the garbage before it s 3 4ers full and then chides me for not being proactive enough she doesn t allow me to wash my sock and clothes together because she feel it s not sanitary even though i m the one who doe my own laundry and when something come up for debate she is relentless after a while i just give up and try to stop the argument i ve tried to make change i go to bed earlier started playing sport again i m eating more fruit washing my clothes the way she want being more proactive with chore etc but there doesn t seem to be any acknowledgement of those change i feel like one thing get crossed off the list only to be replaced by another it tear away at my confidence making me feel a though i m walking on eggshell since i have the divorce ultimatum hanging over my head and i have no voice in our relationship i feel like i m losing myself drifting a bit out to sea this all reached a bit of a breaking point with me when she caught me eating a bowl of granola a few hour before bed she started getting angry with me broke out her laptop and started googling how bad it wa for you to eat before bed funny enough there s actually no scientific knowledge that this is even true she went off about how i m going to get diabetes die young i don t care about myself her etc and started cry she talked down to me like i wa a child and served up another veiled divorce comment since she claim i have a problem with junk food i explained to her that i eat three balanced meal a day have good eating habit and just enjoy my snack in the evening but that wasn t what she wanted to hear i even told her that i ve lost 12 pound in the last 8 month and she claimed that wasn t true and even if it wa that s not enough am i losing it should i just try harder to change or am i in the right to think that this is a much a control issue a it is a me problem i know i have fault but this just seems downright obsessive i want to confront her in an all or nothing sit down where i explain how her criticism and controlling behaviour make me feel but i just feel like thing might further degrade am i not seeing the forest through the tree should i just acknowledge i m the issue and need to step up i m feeling confused and worn out,0

please help complicated situation with my girlfriend of 15 month hi guy amp x200b i really need some serious advice this is a long post because this relationship ha been a roller coaster i ve been with my partner now for 15 month she s of asian descent she s on a bridging visa that recently she had to withdraw it i won t get into this for personal reason i ve known this from early on in our relationship a she had told me she s a beautiful and humble girl she s two year older than me 28 and we ve had some of the greatest of time however there s been a lot of issue throughout our relationship my father didn t approve of my partner a i m of european descent it s an old school mentality and he for a time made it difficult for u however we ve stuck by each other and i ve communicated le with my father because of it we ve done so much together go out hiking travelling almost inseparable that i essentially became codependent on her i realise it isn t healthy i feel that i wa love bombed a early on when we had our first big argument she had made it clear that i had to marry her and that i had to have my own apartment by november the following year which i managed to make one year originally she said 6 month anyhow i think she wa quite angry and we did move past that and we didn t get married but it wa a scary sign early on i would often take her to work for the next 6 month in our relationship to and from work every morning to make it easier and spend extra time with her i ve gone above and beyond and that s not to boast i m constantly there for her when she s upset feeling down can t sleep i mean literally anything she s very dependant in term of how she grew up her father wasn t around and wa a drunk and so she had to fend for herself and sibling coming to now after 15 month we now live with other asian people in a shared house these asian people are of the same nationality a her and they tend to constantly stick up for her when we have an argument i recently moved in after we left our apartment she left me to pay the rent for the following 2 month after a disagreement i then moved in with her in our new place the problem here literally the second day moving in they told me in front of her that i had to and should marry her it s part of their culture i felt uncomfortable a we re still working on a lot of issue of our own and marriage is a big deal for me marriage is security and devotion we needed both i wasn t financially there yet and i wanted to give my partner a great wedding but ever since that moment my partner ha changed her mindset and now say marriage is what she want and if we don t get married we can t be together to be fair i did say at one point let s get married a i thought it would help with the visa process it actually wouldn t it s a lot more complicated than that so i wanted to leave it off but after mentioning it since she won t have it any other way for the last several week we ve been in seperate room we lack intimacy and when we do have intimacy she tell me where still not together and that we haven t been for the past couple of week amp x200b the room mate won t listen to me whatsoever they side with her completely and blame me for her sadness she play the victim and doesn t take any accountability today wa the ceremony and i told her i can t go through with it a we re both not there yet i wa even willing to go back to her country and stat with her and apply for a partner visa and she tell me it not enough amp x200b today she gave me an ultimatum marry me or we re over i m not lowering my standard for you anymore since then i ve tried to communicate she ha ignored me yelled at me and blantly accused me of ruining her special day i feel awful but she s constantly made me feel guilty for everything that s happened in our relationship she lack serious empathy but i love her to death amp x200b she s been calling her room mate who is in charge of the rent and she s now asking me to leave infact she she ha been for quite some time but for the most part my partner ha been telling her no she want me to stay but now i think my time is up because now they re not giving me chance and want me gone because i do not want to go ahead with the marriage at this stage i told her that i love her and i do want to get married but i want to hold it off we re not ready we ve been sleeping in separate room this is what she wanted and i agreed but it s not okay she s not present when i need her she want time alone and doesn t consider my feeling whatsoever i wa thinking about going ahead but my gut is telling me it s a bad idea a i feel it s manipulation and all about what she need and want and not at all what i need or want amp x200b i need advice am i in the wrong i m not trying to crucify my partner that s not my intention i m just looking for another perspective from other people amp x200b of course this is only my side of the story i understand that but i am being genuine in what i m saying a i said i did say to her the idea of marriage but again it wa mainly if it helped the visa to keep her to stay which sadly it didn t but we went ahead with the paper but i don t feel it right a during the month there s been no progress and she s just been apart from me there s also been some trust issue but i genuinely believe it is from my own insecurity i just want to get some advice what to do from here amp x200b she tell me that she love me that much that marriage is crucial otherwise we re not going to be together and i don t believe it s fair a i ve set aside selling everything all of my stuff to make enough money for u to be able to sustain in her country for 12 18 month which is all reliant on me a she ha no saving whatsoever so it s been overwhelming but i wa honestly excited i looked it a a potential long term holiday together for u to re kindle our relationship and i had told her that when we return back to here we could get married it d be perfect amp x200b but since the conversation with her room mate about marriage all the time we slept together in the same room ha now diminished and no longer applies for u which is killing me amp x200b please any advice would mean the world should she be more understanding should there be more compromise i love this girl to death she know it but i m starting to feel like a pawn in this relationship i never have a real say and it s killing me,1

husband 31m is turning into a slob and i 29f don t know what to do i m sorry this is long but please read i would really appreciate the help my husband and i have been together for 8 year and got married this summer in general i would say we have an awesome relationship and he is a fantastic partner we laugh and have fun together he is super supportive of me and doe nice thing for me all the time caring kind loyal fun i love him dearly and this is truly the only sore spot in our relationship our issue revolves around communication criticism and grooming basically if he think he is being told to do something or criticized in any way he dig his heel in further even if he might actually agree with me or if the complaint is legitimate if he feel that i am telling him what to do like how his mom would tell him what to do he rebel against that and just doe the opposite of what i would like him to do this make it almost impossible for me to raise complaint or concern because if i voice my opinion he will dig his heel in deeper insisting that he is fine and my concern are invalid and i am just being controlling i care about etiquette and appearance a lot i don t expect everyone to care a much a i do i genuinely love skin care makeup clothes i love to look good for him do my hair up the way he like etc some of our biggest and only fight have happened around wedding the first wedding we went to i had asked him if he had a nice suit and wa it pressed etc he took that a me saying he is not responsible and can t handle himself and that i wa acting like his mom treating him like a child and telling him what to do he only told me this after the wedding when we had the fight so he would deliberately not try on the suit before hand not iron it and basically look like a slob showing up in a suit three size too big and not ironed the first time he did this at his sister s wedding his family wa so pissed and i wa mortified it s happened a few other time since then which i find unbelievable every time there is a wedding thing are tense between u and i am not allowed to say anything otherwise it s like he will punish me by doing the same thing again he told me that if i would leave him alone he would take care of himself because he s a grown man etc so i do sometimes it work sometimes it doesn t clothes is one thing but now i am reaching a breaking point because this attitude ha crept into his hygiene over the past year he ha started showering much le and only brush his teeth once a day if that it s affected how i feel about him i am often uncomfortable during sex and it s a big turn off he doesn t groom himself a much let s his beard and hair get a long a he want even though he know i really don t like it when he doe trim it he insists on cutting it all himself if i suggest that someone else should cut it because it s always uneven he dig his heel in further and from now on will only ever do it himself whereas before he had a barber he used to care about looking good he used to take pride in his appearance i don t know what happened i feel i am constantly walking on eggshell trying not to wound his pride or seem controlling he just cannot tolerate any comment whatsoever about his grooming or appearance he always see it a an effort to control him and go right back to being a little boy being told what to do by his mom i m worried that i am being controlling i don t know how to stop i m in a really tough spot because if i dare to even mention it i know he will only dig his heel in further and it ll be lost it s infuriating and so so hurtful i feel so disrespected it s always the same thing his fear of me controlling him which mean that i rarely bring anything up and always hope that he will take care of himself but thing have gotten worse i feel so stuck this morning wa a breaking point a we were getting ready he went to kiss me and i said wait i didn t brush my teeth yet and he said me neither a he wa leaving the bathroom and proceeds to go downstairs to head to work so i say hey you forgot to brush your teeth and he s like i don t brush them in the morning which made my heart absolutely sink i asked him please can you brush your teeth trying to be a non confrontational a possible and he said no and once again we entered the dynamic where i m the mean mommy telling his son what to do and i want to fucking cry and scream and leave i ve painted such an awful picture of him but the reason this is all so strange is that he isn t like this is any other area of life he cook he clean he is neat and tidy he take amazing care of our dog maintains the house he is an ideal man and super responsible and on top of thing except when it come to this our communication is mostly ok outside of this issue i don t get it i m worried he may be depressed he used to put effort into his appearance and seemed to enjoy looking good for me i want that man back is it controlling to want your spouse to maintain a certain level of hygiene and appearance should i just leave it and accept that this is who he is where is the line between being respectful to your partner taking care of yourself and having too high standard maybe i am controlling or demanding i honestly don t know anymore most importantly how can i bring this up to him in a way that won t make him shut down and shut me out making the mommy son dynamic even worse i hate this dynamic so so so much tldr husband ha been lowering the standard of hygiene grooming and appearance over time when i bring it up he feel i am trying to control him and just dig his heel in deeper i am stuck and don t know how to move forward in a productive way,0
my 28f fiance 29m doesn t understand the concept of mental load think i don t do enough been together 3 5 year engaged for 1 year me lawyer working 50 hour per week bringing in six figure i am doing very well at work i own our house i don t spend much time cooking and cleaning because i usually have to work at home in the evening and on night when i don t i don t feel like doing housework my neglected hobby include writing photography and playing piano him used to work in it wa fired last winter for repeated absence lateness and general insubordination went back to school part time online to finish his bachelor s degree after that but hate it and will probably drop out after this semester ha a few chore that he doe semi regularly dish mowing the lawn trash i have to remind him to do them sometimes if he forgets to do something i m never surprised he also take care of our two dog the old dog is mine i had him before the relationship and we bought the puppy together his hobby is video game mostly wow but he s been playing other stuff more lately i ll say a little bit about why i like him since that seems to be a common first question we got engaged in the summer of 2018 and we re supposed to get married in a little under a year when we got engaged he wa gainfully employed we had talked about him maybe quitting to go back to school but nothing wa set in stone yet he had and still supposedly ha aspiration to do something different in it it sounded like he wanted to make a true career out of a particular it niche i m pretty decent with computer and i liked listening to him talk about what he wa doing when he wa tinkering with them he helped me pick out part for my new computer we first bonded over the one mmo that we both played neither of u play much anymore except when there s a new expansion we like pretty much all of the same music and we ve both introduced each other to new artist and genre we ve done a good bit of traveling together and have had a great time he s smart we both follow politics but he follows closer than i do and he keep me filled in he ha a quirky sense of humor it ll sound like he s going to say something serious but he ll say something totally ridiculous instead all with a straight face it make me laugh even now i have a very stressful job and that sense of humor and his general laid back nature ha definitely helped me not take it more seriously than i have to he s also been a great listener when i m dealing with problem at work with family etc neither of u want child and we seem to enjoy the same thing in life when we got engaged i had zero reservation everything wa great so what happened like we had discussed he went back to school after he got fired i thought he wa going to go to school full time so that he d finish the degree in a year or two but for some reason that i still don t fully understand he only enrolled part time two course he did well on his first two course but thing started falling apart on the next two i had helped him with one of the first two course a math course because he hate math we would sit down together and i would talk him through his homework i would try to point him in the right direction but he wa the one holding the pen the second pair of course wa another math course and something it related one night when i wa trying to help him with math he fell asleep a i wa explaining something now i m not a good teacher i never wanted to be one it s hard for me to make dry topic interesting still it s not really my job to be his teacher i had a hundred other thing i wanted to do at that moment but i m his partner and i wanted to help so i wa doing my best that being said i wa incensed that he fell asleep for some reason instead of telling him to do the damn course himself i decided that it would be easier faster for me to just do it for him so i did and i spent way le time on it than i would have if i had to teach him i got a 99 with the other course he had to take a midterm i think it wa an essay he mentioned that he didn t know when it wa due i assumed that he would figure that out but he didn t the due date came and went and he missed it he told me that he missed the due date and somehow managed not to blow up i told him that he needed to e mail or better call the professor and beg for either an extension or some way to not fail the course i can t remember if he contacted the professor or not but the outcome wa still that he failed instead of losing my shit i asked what he wanted to do he could continue going to school or go back to work i didn t care either way i did say that if he went back to school that he couldn t screw that kind of thing up ever again he then told me that he hated school that he isn t disciplined enough to do the program but that he would try two more course he s taking those course now and afaik he s doing fine still it sound like he s going to drop out of school and he ha no concrete plan about looking for a job he wa also talking about getting his a certification but he s been talking about that for year and it hasn t happened side note on school he had a significant financial windfall and would be able to pay to finish his degree without going into debt onto the issue of mental load on top of my job i keep the house running i pay all of the bill and make 99 of the home purchase i don t clean enough i ll admit that but any time anything in the house ha been seriously cleaned i ve been the one to do it anything that requires handiness fall to me i feel a though i have to tell him to do thing that he should know to do himself we had two light bulb burned out in the living room for a month i finally changed them and when he thanked me for doing it i asked why he didn t sooner his lame excuse wa that he didn t know where we keep the light bulb we ve lived together for three year and i ve kept them in the same place that whole time he claim that when i tell him to do thing he always doe them but that isn t true there were time when he wouldn t mow the lawn for a month our lawn is very small it take about ten minute to mow with the reel mower the sink would be completely full of dirty dish before he d clean them if i say something to him about it then i m nagging and i have a lot of nerve for getting on his as about everything he told me that i didn t have the right to bother him about thing he doesn t do because he told me to put a trickle charger on my motorcycle and i haven t done it yet he doesn t understand the difference between me telling him to do basic thing that need to be done for the household to function and him suggesting that i do something to take better care of my toy i ve been bringing these issue up more often and it hasn t gone well i told him that i feel like the project manager of the house and that it s too much to deal with on top of my job he ha two argument and i can t seem to get through to him on either of them 1 he is demanding that i make him a list not understanding that i m still the project manager if i do that why do i need to tell him to change the water filter in the fridge when the light turn red why do i need to tell him to clean up the coffee ground all over the counter after he make coffee why do i need to tell him that it s unacceptable to leave dirty dish in the sink when we go on vacation i know plenty of people male and female who know these thing without being told i asked him to read the gemma hartley article in harper s bazaar about mental load and he said that he felt bad for the husband he said that because i wa unable to make a list of thing he doesn t do immediately off the top of my head that his contribution to our relationship is acceptable 2 his second issue make slightly more sense but still doesn t let him off the hook i have some stuff around the house that i just never found a home for since i moved in and i ve been slowly putting it away when i have time feel like doing it the house need different furniture and we need to contract out a few project for the setup to be final it take a while because i am in charge of all of that and it s expensive he argues that he cannot clean and shouldn t have to clean because of the stuff i have around the house these thing do not prevent him from cleaning he would have a way better argument for me to hurry up and put my stuff away if he were actively trying to clean e g i d like to clean this table but you have thing on it yesterday wa the first time that he offered to help me put my thing away all of the other time when we ve had this argument he s just told me that he refuse to put my thing away honestly i don t know how he d help me put my thing away but my thing do not prevent him from vacuuming and mopping the floor cleaning the kitchen cleaning the bathroom dusting etc i get the sense that he just doesn t want to help me that he ha become complacent in the last eight month i work my as off and he mostly just play video game for a while he wasn t even coming to bed i had to ask that he not stay up all night playing i just missed him when wow classic came out that wa pretty much all he did he doesn t play a much anymore but that still seems to be the only thing he want to do my understanding is that when he s not doing schoolwork i can t imagine he spends more than 5 hour a week on school he s either playing game sleeping or watching tv i can t even trust him to be available when i have a contractor come to the house i told him when the gas company would be coming one day and he claimed he never heard his phone ring so they didn t come and i got chewed out when i tried to reschedule i had to stay home from work to ensure that it got done last night he wa complaining about having to throw my trash away and do my dish after dinner i asked so you re saying that living a very comfortable life wanting for nothing is not worth having to throw some of my trash away that all the work i do isn t enough for you to do my dish he basically said that i wasn t giving him enough because i wasn t spending enough time with him he then proceeded to sleep on the couch and refused to do anything for the rest of the night when i had no work to do and we could ve done something he knew that some note on that his birthday present wa a trip abroad to see a musical that he didn t get to see when it wa

me what he would pay to live on his own is more than enough and that he shouldn t actually have to pay me anything because he doesn t have a job he buy himself all the expensive toy and game he want he is now accusing me of making all of these complaint up and that the real issue is that i m not attracted to him anymore that couldn t be further from the truth and it hurt so much to hear him say

i 30f recently became permanantly disabled and my best friend 31f told me that s too inconvenient for her and to call her when i get better two year later i m convenient again and she want to hang out we spent a lot of time together i worked and studied from home so i wa always able to adjust my schedule to match hers to meet up for thing which looking back at probably made me an extremely convenient friend we have been friend for over 10 year my friend and i were maid of honor at our wedding we started hanging out a lot le initially when i moved a 20 minute drive away from her and started working an office job slowly anything we did had to become within a 5 minute drive of her place or at her place she constantly brought up how much she disliked that i didn t purchase my house closer to the house she wa renting about two year ago my health fell apart i wa in the hospital multiple time for stay and surgery while we tried to figure out what wa wrong with me and how to fix it i felt terrified for my future for the first year i wa almost completely housebound scared and in constant pain during that first year i wa so unwell i had zero capability to keep up social commitment at all a few friend visited me but she came a total of zero time when i d call to see how she wa doing she would talk a lot about new friend she had made and what she wa doing with the time we used to spend together that s fine i thought she s moved on she need social activity and it s not a if i can go do these thing right now she would ask to meet to catch up but driving 20 minute to my house wa too far so i had to have my husband help me shower dress get out and into the car bring me into a cafe exactly halfway or le between our house and then wait around for me to be ready to leave i couldn t eat or drink anything there and i didn t really have anything to talk about except all the thing going wrong with my health so i d just listen to her talk about what she s been doing we only did this two or three time she mentioned a friend she reconnected with that ha a disability she drive this person around so they can do thing together another friend moved 3 hour away so she s been driving there and staying over to hang out it sting a bit but i think by this point i m ready to let go of her a we are leaving i think she s kind of realised what she s just said to me because her tone change and she apologised without actually saying sorry that she doesn t know why she can drive 3 hour for one friend but not 20 minute for me that she miss hanging out and she want to do this more in the future when i contact her later to make these future plan though it s back to being a hassle other friend kind of dropped off too and in the darkest part of my life i felt totally alone aside from my husband but putting my entire social burden on him on top of everything else is so much in one of the last conversation we had on the phone during this time she told me what i wa going through sounded awful and to call her when i got better i m not going to get better ever she know this i got a call recently she got a job walking distance away from my place suddenly i am convenient again for lunch time i ve heard more from her in the lead up to her starting this new job than i have in the last two year i understand that not being able to do the same thing in the same way i could before is going to change the dynamic of my relationship what i m not sure about is if i m willing to move past feeling abandoned because it s convenient now i m not sure how easy it will be for me in the future to make new friend and i ve been pretty lonely am i being ridiculous here to have hurt feeling it feel bizarre at 30 to be so hung up on this but i m pretty afraid of being alone do i just move on past this and haul my as to meet her to fill her lunch time now tl dr a friend i thought i wa very close to didn t want to see me when i became disabled because it wa inconvenient to have to drive 20 minute two year later after barely speaking she got a job nearby and want me to come meet her for lunch because i m so close now i don t know if that s bad behaviour from a friend or if i need to be le sensitive about feeling abandoned by her at a tough time,0
i 16f do beauty pageant and i want to stop and have the money saved for college instead my family is fighting over it i have done pageant since i wa 9 and i know they get a bad reputation but there have been many thing i like about them they made me get over my fear of public speaking and face my fear of embarrassing myself in front of people i used to be very socially anxious and they did load for my social skill and confidence so when i have part time job interview or school presentation now i am very confident and comfortable i also enjoy the fashion side of it fashion and makeup is a passion of mine but recently i ve been kind of fed up with how restrictive the pageant i do are about what is acceptable to wear i m more into experimental runway style stuff recently anyway this year my family ha been taking a lot about college about financing it specifically my parent have a small college fund for me but it won t cover everything i ll be applying for grant and scholarship and loan to cover a lot of it and i ll be the one paying the loan back after graduation depending on where i study how much my parent contribute what kind of grant and scholarship i get and what kind of loan i get i could end up with a lot of debt debt scare me because i ve seen some friend family get really deep in that hole i want to get into a stem field i m thinking i m interested in computer science so i hopefully will be able to pay them down but still debt stress me out recently i ve also been trying to learn about finance and budgeting and investing too because in a few year i ll need to handle my own money i already am doing that a little because i had a job this summer at a day camp and while learning about money my parent have showed me a lot about how they budget the tool and spreadsheet they use about saving up for something over time about investment and retirement saving basically every part of their budget and it wa really surprising to see how much money wa going towards pageant like i knew it wa expensive but putting it in comparison to the mortgage and car payment to what tuition would cost it really put thing in proportion to me like it s been a passion of mine but is it really worth all that the cost of dress hair shoe makeup dance lesson flight hotel pageant fee tanning etc it wa a lot and it could make a huge dent in the cost of college so i told my parent that i wanted to stop pageant for my last two year of high school and put all the money that wa budgeted for them towards a college fund i thought that would be a reasonable thing to ask for it wa money they wanted to spend on me anyway and i think that asking for college money is like the most responsible thing i could do and it didn t go well my mom think i m overreacting giving up on something i love because i m stressing about money even though i m too young to really understand it my dad say they were happy to spend on my dream and that we can make pageant and college work but i know money doesn t grow in tree you spend it on one thing and there s le for other thing that s just how it is my mom keep talking about the pageant i wa going to do this year a new one i can do now that i m 16 it s a big deal and how it s something to bond over a a family something we were all looking forward to and how i should think more before giving it up my mom also told me that it s not my money i can t just decide where it go if i decide to not do pageant is there any way i could convince them tldr i want to stop doing beauty pageant and save the money for college how do i convince my parent,0

at a crossroad with my m24 gf s f24 body confidence problem so me and my gf have been together around 18 month now we get along amazingly and have a lot of common interest but in some area we have quite different interest in one sense it s become an issue she s very athletic she s very interested in fitness and she doe martial art i m more of an indoors guy i m not really into sport but she s always been very eager to share thing about judo and her other activity and i always liked it i enjoy seeing her be passionate about thing i have no idea about the problem ha come from her idea of her fitness and how her interest seem to feed into it she s in terrific shape she scarcely ever eats a dessert she go for a run every day and she ha several session of training a week which each last a few hour i m a tall relatively in shape guy but i m hardly ripped or super skinny or whatever i try to eat healthy and i jog a little and do some light weight i feel ok with the level i m at but yeah i know i m not in amazing condition but she ha insecurity too of course i thought it wa just the same a anyone else ha a pal of hers once told her she had lost weight since they last met and i spent the evening assuring her in tear that she hadn t been fat before her mother is also very health conscious and i try and tell her not to take what her mum say so seriously recently she s been talking about getting a pt for some session and thing she can cut from her evening to get more time to go to the gym or new course she can do to get more in shape i try to be encouraging and tell her she s doing well and looking great but i m scared i m just feeding into some kind of a compulsion to do more exercise and be validated for it last month wa my birthday and we were out for dinner my parent took u to a nice restaurant and we had a big meal i had some pasta some dessert and 3 4 beer once we got home we re lying in bed to go to sleep and she asked do you normally have so many beer with such a big dinner i said no but we don t go out for dinner much and it wa my birthday i also had been offered a grad job that week so it wa kind of a double celebration after some more comment on what i ordered she told me she wa worried because i had put on some weight recently i knew this it had been on my mind already i told her i knew and wa working on it i tried not to seem upset but the fact that she brought that up on that particular night and made me feel like such a slob after such a great time i have to admit it hurt me a lot she s always been a very sensitive person and it just seemed wildly out of character it s had a social impact in that she won t come out if people are drinking she obviously doesn t want to drink beer or wine because of the calorie i tell her nobody care if she ha soft drink but she say she feel pressured if others will be having some so i go out to see friend and she stay in or go to the gym while i m away i just feel like she s turning from a loving confident person with a wide range of interest including a love of sport into someone who s just totally obsessed with physical fitness and i think not in a positive way it break my heart because she s beautiful and easily the healthiest person ive ever known but still this thing seems to now be affecting her wider life and i don t know if i m helping or making it worse tl dr my sporty already highly athletic girlfriend ha completely unrealistic concern about her body and ha taken to a complete lifestyle overhaul which i feel i ve encouraged and now it s straining our relationship,0

question about sexual trauma wordage trigger warning discussion of sexual abuse so i had a really intense debate with someone over what is consent now it s making me question the wordage i used for what happened between me and my abusive ex i cannot stop thinking about it and i thought i would ask people here for your input i have always used the word rape for what happened between me and my ex but now i m not sure my memory is very fussy on all the detail of that day but essentially my ex wanted u to have sex and i wa not really in the mood for it he ended up locking the door and telling me i couldn t leave until we had sex i had a phone with me and everything but i froze and started freaking out i felt trapped and went into survival mode i thought the only way i could leave wa to have sex with him once i calmed myself down a bit i agreed to sex even though i didn t want it i seriously held back tear during the whole thing just so he would be done and i could leave is the person i wa talking to invalidating my experience or are they correct they agreed it wa very wrong but pointed out that rape not the correct term it s made me question myself so much over the last day i ve been trying to look up the different definition but they are all really confusing if someone give consent under duress is it really giving consent because i thought it wasn t i suppose the language doesn t matter because it wa extremely violating and i know what i felt in that moment and how i feel about the experience in the present but now i feel like i need to know the correct wordage wa it rape sexual assault sexual misconduct or even something else i don t know if this is the correct place to ask this either so please let me know if it isn t i m so confused i really appreciate any feedback,1

11 year monogamous relationship and now he want to be poly are we destined for failure my 27f boyfriend 28m of 11 year ha recently told me he would like to start a poly relationship with a girl at his work for some background we have done long distance in the past and are now doing long distance again for my school about 2 hour away we see each other every 2 4 week we have an amazing sex life and we are absolutely perfect for each other aside from him wanting other relationship and me wanting to be monogamous when he told me he wanted an open relationship a few year ago i wa crushed i cried for a while and i think the answer i gave him wa that i didn t want to do it but also didn t want to take away his happiness i think i ended up saying yes but that i wasn t happy about it the most he ever did wa kiss one of his friend and even that crushed me he recently told me he read more than two and realized that he wanted to try to be poly now much more recently a new girl ha started at his work and they ve very quickly become friend they hang out outside of work and it wa very obvious to me that they were both into each other by the way he wa describing their interaction knowing that he like someone hasn t ever really bothered me a long a he isn t acting on it a few day ago he told me he got a text from this new girl saying that she is really into him he had told her before that he wa probably poly a a person but not in his current relationship she s been in a poly relationship before and she just wanted to lay everything out and talk about it some more and make sure everyone is happy she didn t want to make him or me uncomfortable or impose anything he told me he knew i wouldn t want a poly relationship so he wa nervous to tell me but he also let me know that there wa no way in heck he d want any sort of relationship that didn t involve staying with me i ve been cry almost non stop for a couple day now and i had a panic attack yesterday just thinking about it and coming to the conclusion that we might break up which neither of u want he told me he love me so much and want to spend forever with me and that his feeling for her change nothing about how he feel about me i told him i d been thinking about how this might end with u breaking up since we both wanted different thing and he said he doesn t ever want to break up and that i m his family he say the way he picture the relationship would be that he and i would get married and buy a house together and he would occasionally hang out with his other girlfriend a his secondary partner and that maybe i could be friend with her he also told me the relationship with the other girl probably wouldn t last that long because she move pretty often and wasn t planning on staying in their city forever i asked him if he would hate me if i just said no to the whole thing and he said he wouldn t hate me but he d rather try it out and stop than not try at all especially since it won t last forever and that she feel the same way i told him it would feel so wrong if i let them start a relationship and then force them to stop just because i can t handle it he drove down to see me last night for a quick sleepover since i had told him the day before that i needed a hug and he really wanted a hug and a snuggle too he told me that they would take it slow and maybe eventually he would start bringing her to his family gathering i basically sobbed at this point i felt like him bringing her to his family gathering when i couldn t go wa like stabbing me in the heart he then said that his family probably wouldn t allow that and would get upset he said he wa sorry for hurting me and that he wished he wasn t so complicated and wanted to just want me he told me if i wa more comfortable with them just being friend with benefit that they would be ok with that i feel like he s already decided that he s going to start a relationship with this girl and it s just up to me to set boundary but i really don t want any of it to happen i don t feel like he s really listening to me or seeing how much it s hurting me inside i wish i wa able to be happy about him having another girlfriend i don t know what to do i don t want to lose him but i also don t want to take away his happiness and have him resent me forever but i also feel that the amount of hurt it would cause me would outweigh the happiness the 2 of them would gain but maybe i m just being selfish tl dr my bf want a poly relationship with a new girl at work and i want to say no but i don t know if i m being selfish should i just say yes and try it out is this whole thing going to blow up in the end anyway,0

update my 25m girlfriend 27f opened up about her past while drunk not sure if i should talk about it or ignore it original i don t know how else to start this but last night my girlfriend broke up with me i m extremely grateful for all the advice i got on my original post a few day after the original post i sat down with her and talked about it she seemed to really appreciate what i said and thing seemed to be quite okay between u but thing quickly changed she ha a long history with severe depression and anxiety and due to a lot of different factor this came back extremely hard in the time between then and now we were supposed to meet last night to watch a movie at my place but at the last moment she asked to meet somewhere else i don t want to delve too deep into how the conversation went but we talked for quite some time about our relationship and her depression she wa feeling like a burden to me that she couldn t support me right now the way that i supported her since the start that she is feeling incredibly guilty about that imbalance and she wa constantly saying that she s a mess that i m too good for her and she doesn t deserve me and that i ve been the most supportive boyfriend she s ever had i tried telling her there s a reason i want to date her and no one else that i think she s an extremely strong person and that i care deeply about her she asked me what if it never get better to which i replied that that s a risk i m willing to take but none of it seemed to come through at the end i asked if she had made her mind up she said she need time and space to get her health insurance set up get a schedule for her medication talk to a counselor and heal she said that she want to stay in touch and when she s feeling better she might want to give it another chance i said that wa okay and she gave me a big hug before leaving after i sent her a message that it hurt me to see her pushing me away that i wa hoping we would get through this together but that i respect her decision and hope that she ll overcome this i told her she can always call me if she want to talk she thanked me for being so understanding but it hurt her to think she wa doing the wrong thing for me in the run i m absolutely devastated right now i don t blame her for doing this i can absolutely see why she s doing it but that doesn t make it any easier for me she ha no one here i want to be there for her the best i can but she won t allow me what maybe also hurt me is the fact that she took the decision for me to prevent me from being hurt by her depression again i can understand why but at least it would have been my decision and if in the end it didn t work out then i would have been to blame i really hope she can find the help she need and in the mean time i ll give her some space but try to stay in touch like she asked to check how she s doing i m nowhere near ready to start dating again anytime soon and i know it could take month but i m gonna try my best to still be there for her if she want me to the only thing i m not yet sure about though is if maybe i should ask next week if she would want to call for a short bit next weekend if it s up to me and if she s willing to down the line which she said i want to get back together with her and give it another chance i would like this to be a period where she just need space but it not being the end of our relationship i want her to know that and emphasize that her health is number 1 priority and i respect her decision i would hugely appreciate some advice on this tl dr girlfriend broke up with me due the depression need space to heal and maybe want to get back together when she s feeling better,0

my abuser left my f22 abusive boyfriend m25 left me today you think i would be more happy about it,1
my story kinda of abusive just need reassurance i have a history of people pleasing i need validation from others to reassure myself i m currently going to therapy think i started like last month and the change and clarity to my life have been outstanding but unsettling at moment tried to see if one of your story is like mine but i don t see any maybe because it s more of a mental abuse but one can say i wa to partially blame for not speaking up i have dated my bf for four year he love being around me but we sometimes always watch his show but we like similar thing i would say the most abusive thing he ha done is pressure me to give him blow job which i have stated i don t like and hurt but still consists and critique them if i m not doing it right which is something i never had a bf do before one night for sure crossed the line when he had me do something i kept saying no to but disregarded and continued and i allowed which part of me feel like to blame because i should have walked away but people who love you take no for an answer and respect that i m always catering to his need i ve waited four year to see if he could improve on his career that he hate while i work two job to achieve my goal since i come home late sometimes he expects me to bring back food because he refuse to cook i cook every time i m home with no help and this past two month i finally got the gut to ask him to do the dish which he ha done this week without me finally asking just because he know i m unhappy tonight i want to have a talk with him about my expectation changing i packed my bag so i could possibly leave tomorrow i shouldn t even be questioning it but i feel guilty i never told him what he wa doing wrong and i feel like a bitch for throwing away four year so randomly if anything i need to do it for my recovery ive been sober from alcohol for 2 5 year but he like to drink often i also been using kratom behind his back for the majority of the relationship which caused me to have low self esteem and that s why i felt like i always owed him and don t deserve anyone really im off the pill for basically three month now so my confidence is back but obviously something wa wrong for me to do that for so long im scared to leave him but i feel like this is my happy ending to my story that s what i keep telling myself his friend and mom kept pushing him to marry me and he know i wanted this in the past but ha done nothing to show it i dream of them seeing that i no longer took his shit if anything at least this can be a learning lesson for him it s so sad i have to think of the benefit for him to help me do this but i m also telling myself it s not okay for me to stay unhappy this whole self value thing is sorta new to me again and it make me sick that i let yet again another man get in the way of that,1
fiancé 34m is angry i 36f want to postpone having a baby until we re actually married i m questioning if i jumped the gun on accepting a proposal before we start i m on mobile excuse formatting blah blah blah ok i 36 f dated my now fiancé 34 m for 2 year off and on at the beginning of this year i told him my goal for the next couple year relationship engagement marriage pregnancy he initially said he didn t feel he wa ready i started dating another guy and broke it off with him he continued to essentially chase me for the bulk of 2019 in october i broke up with the other guy and fiancé came back into the picture he stated he wa now ready and proposed this week with u being in our mid 30 s and short on cash i suggested an elopement and reception at our first anniversary he agreed he then stated he wa ready for family planning i m thinking great we ve been throwing caution to the wind for the last 2 month i mentioned this week when he would like to elope and he is now saying he want to wait a year make sure we re ready then get married i wa disappointed but agreeable after thinking more about it i felt we should stop family planning i don t judge anyone who ha had a child out of wedlock but that is not something i want to do i told him i wa agreeable to wait on the wedding but that moving forward we needed to use protection to prevent pregnancy he essentially blew up at me he said i wa now flip flopping on our plan and that i ruined his day i stated i didn t want to be a baby mama and wanted to have our child once we had firmer plan to actually marry he then accused me of questioning his integrity and claim my statement is proof i don t trust him to take care of our future kid for me it s not that i just wanted to have that experience in the confines of our marriage and if he need a year to make sure he s ready then i don t want to bring a child into the uncertainty of it the way he reacted ha caused an immediate gut reaction of distrust for me if you truly have plan to marry me then what s the big deal in waiting 6 month the reason i feel this way is in the past when we discussed moving our relationship forward he said to me we can get engaged but i m not sure if i want to get married amp why doe the government need to be in our business when i accepted his proposal he said he had a complete change of heart and now want to marry so now i feel like my guard is up am i justified or is this weird tldr fiancé had a drastic reaction to postponing trying for a baby and now i am questioning our entire engagement,0

i 28 f recently found out that the guy 27 m that i ve been dating for a month ha known about me for long before that without going too deep into detail i have a sizeable following on instagram not a skinny tea model or fashion nova girl or whatever i just post landscape photography and whatever that i find interesting my personal account wa accessible for year but i wa forced to set it to private after an incident where a follower had managed to track down my building and waited for me outside of the lobby when he knew i wa heading back from the airport after a trip to new york i don t have any roommate so a you can imagine i wa scared a shit when he refused to leave after i had said no to just one drink the incident lasted no more than a few minute and i haven t seen him since had to get the authority involved in order to get him to leave but the impression it left on me ha lasted all these month my wall are up and i hardly post on my personal account even though it s private now a little over a month ago one of my friend invited me to his art show i wa originally going to stay home that night a i wasn t feeling well but at the last last minute i changed my mind and went over to support my friend and to say hello to everyone there i met eric at first i thought he wa kind of rude we were waiting in line to use the bathroom and he wa ahead of me one spot but i really had to go so i asked him if i could cut ahead before i wet myself right there in front of everyone lmao he looked at me like i wa insane and just turned back around and continued scrolling through some shit on his phone a if i hadn t said a word by the time it wa his turn he did let me use the bathroom so i thanked him on my way out and he warmed up to me a bit and we ended up talking all night and exchanging phone number after that we met up for lunch and really hit it off i remember texting one of my friend on my way home that day saying i think i just met my husband soon enough our lunch date turned into dinner and drink and then a full blown romantic home cooked meal at his apartment which wa immaculately clean and decorated with print of some of my favourite photograph of all time it wa too good to be true and i fell for him hard part of me wa a little suspicious that he had lied to me about not knowing my instagram page not because i m that big on there but because he just seemed to like everything that i liked before i had even had the chance to say that i liked it there wa also one coffee date where he knew to order u a blueberry scone i figured it wa a coincidence at the time i didn t invent blueberry scone he could easily like him too but there were more weird coincidence like that which of course didn t deter from me opening my life up to him for the first time in a long time i wa dating someone and happy with the way thing were going between u and so i tried not to overthink every little detail thing eventually took a turn when i used his laptop to order u food whilst he wa in the shower one weekend i would normally have used my phone to order food but it wa in the other room and i wa lazy because we had just had sex so his laptop seemed like the best option he wa never protective of his phone or laptop in fact he wa very open with me about everything he would show me funny message between him and his friend and always try to include me in every inside joke and thing like that taking that into consideration i wa very surprised to find out that he had left his secret instagram account logged in on his laptop at first i thought it wa someone else s account a there were no photo on it and a he wa only following three account two of them being my photography and personal account and the other his actual account but i quickly connected the dot and genuinely sat there in shock for a solid five or so minute by the time he wa out of the shower i didn t know what to say he had to have been following my personal account for a good few month at least from before i had set it to private and stopped accepting follower request that mean he had not only lied to me about not knowing me beforehand which he had emphasized without my having asked but also that for the past month of dating and getting to know each other he had made it so he wa a step ahead of me at all time it could have been that he genuinely wa being himself but he still lied to me and had an unfair advantage he ordered food for u and we ate together for a few minute before i finally asked him about his secret account at first he just looked at me in silence but he eventually came clean he didn t try to cover it up with more lie which wa at least a little bit comforting but the damage wa done i asked him for the full truth under the pretense that i might be able to look past everything if he would just be honest with me this one time and so he explained that he went to that art show knowing that i wa supposed to be there and wa cold to me at first because he wa nervous and didn t want me to know that he wa a follower he said he didn t think it wa going to spiral into what it is now and that he assumed that i would lose interest in him after one date but i didn t and so he kept having to lie it wa shocking to hear not at all flattering i told him that i needed space but first asked to see his laptop again i did a bit of quick searching and found all of the comment that he had left on my photo which went back an entire year he had never commented anything gross or inappropriate only supportive comment and cute emojis and thing like that but again it started basically a year ago which mean he ha had a year to get to know certain aspect of my personality that wasn t what i had signed up for when we had started dating last month i don t date follower for that reason it s an unfair advantage and it s usually a case where they want the version of me that exists on social medium and not the actual living and breathing version in front of them sound a bit dramatic but it s a genuine problem the fact that he went to that art show specifically because he knew i would be there that part i find disturbing looking back on that night it all feel so calculated and manufactured he claim he ha been real with me about everything else his dream his interest and his personal history although i ve met his friend and i know that he wa honest about the basic of his life it s still so disturbing and upsetting to me that he had gone out of his way to manipulate the situation to his advantage i went home that day and ended up puking due to the anxiety and flat out sadness of everything i wa so happy before i knew the truth to the point that i wished i hadn t found the account he wa so good to me and apart from all of those coincidence that now make sense there wa a real connection that i hadn t felt in a very long time part of me want to give him another chance because well he ha respected my wish and ha told me everything and been really vulnerable with me from the moment i asked him about the account i know that doesn t change the fact that he lied which still make me sick thinking about it but it s comforting to know that he s not delusional and way over the edge like that other guy who found my building he know he fucked up in a huge way i felt the sincerity in his apology and the absolute shame in his explanation and he ha respected my request for space it shouldn t matter so much that he s doing the bare minimum but i mean it matter some a fucked up and sad a it sound i don t actually know that i want to cut him out of my life like i had originally thought i wa going to not sure how to go about this without potentially facing even more lie do i trust that he told me the truth in full honestly i m leaning towards a yes a the explanation he gave me wa so humiliating that it can t have been a lie we haven t spoken for a week now some day i fall into a panic and assume that he ha taken secret video recording of u having sex and is going to post them if i stop seeing him and some day i want to text him and just say fuck it to all of that and give him another chance talk sense into me i don t know what to do i feel like such an unbelievable fucking idiot tl dr i have a bit of a following on instagram and he lied about not knowing me when he first met i haven t talked to him for a week which wa when i found out and he ha told me everything and his word and apology feel very sincere but he still lied to me for a month regardless we had a connection and part of me want to give him another chance even though i know that s probably a terrible fucking idea talk sense into me,0

doe your abuser ever fuck with your job and other manipulative thing my 25f boyfriend 33m say to me this is sort of going to be a long post but i just feel like putting it all out there thing my boyfriend ha done doe 1 accuses me of cheating i work at a bar and if i don t come home before midnight he get pissed once i had to close 2am and came home to find all of my stuff piled in the corner a lot of it broken problem is asking to go home earlier piss my coworkers off and now i might be getting fired for it 2 he pick fight over the most insignificant thing right before i have to go to work i always end up cry because he ha learned exactly what get to me below the belt kind of fighting and criticism he pick these fight literally while i m rushing around getting my stuff together and i don t want my stuff to end up in a corner or broken when i get home so i try to end the conversation respectfully but he s just calling me a bitch the whole time and telling me how immature i am the more mature i try to be during fight the angrier he get i end up being late for work and looking like shit another reason why i might get fired 3 his other favorite time to pick fight is in the middle of the night it feel like he doe this on purpose he find something in whatever i m doing or saying and becomes insanely defensive and childish with no calm sit down problem solving attempt at an explanation he just start talking under his breath about what an inconsiderate selfish cunt i am while slamming the dish around then walk into the bedroom and close the door which mean i am banished to the couch where i can never sleep this is why 4 there wa a time before when i would try to go to bed after his dramatic show and he would tell me to get the fuck out and i wouldn t he would then take it upon himself to make sure i leave at any cost sometimes that wa continuing with the venomous insult until i couldn t take it anymore and walk out he would then say something like yeah i figured you were going to do something childish like get up and leave face it like a fucking adult sometimes he would kick me off my side of the bed and then there were time that he physically shoved pulled me up by the hair and threw me he s pretty big and i m tiny once he pushed my head to the ground and put his full weight on his knee behind my neck once he threw me down sat on top of me and choked me until i almost passed out sooooo when he go to bed in a huff i feel pretty justified in my decision to not gamble with laying in bed next to him but then he say it s my fault he s so mad and my fault i didn t sleep because i had every opportunity to come in and lay down and apologize and then everything would have been okay 5 he play mind game with me one night he literally texted me hey love maybe we ve been spending too much time together if you wanna hang out for a bit after work with your friend that would be totally fine so i thanked him and stayed after well apparently he wa being sarcastic and i wa supposed to know that and staying made me an extremely selfish person and a terrible partner then he accused me of flirting with a guy while i wa there i wasn t and said he couldn t be with someone who would have such appallingly bad judgement he literally said that wa a test an easy one and you failed i ve been losing so much sleep getting so depressed literally physically sick losing my mind with his dumb game they re all affecting my employment he say i don t make enough at my work and i need to get a new job he s right i m not making enough but that s because i m like a shell of myself and i can t see a future anymore it s all blank and i m constantly either sick sleep deprived or responding to his text while i m at work so he can be reassured that yes i really am at work and not cheating on him and then asking to leave early so nothing happens to my stuff i don t feel comfortable switching job without at least some saving but he tell me that i m ungrateful and selfish and lazy for not doing so or going after job i have no chance of getting he s really good at making me feel like i am le than worthless and there s no reason for me to be a burden on the earth anymore sorry i know that wa long i just had to let out some of the pressure i haven t seen anything on here about abuser fucking with employment before so i wa curious if it had happened to anyone else,1

i wa the emotionally abusive one and now he is some detail my boyfriend 30m and i 25f have been together for two year we met online and instantly hit it off after over a year and a half of online dating i flew to him to meet in person for a five night stay in early august i have recently flown back to him for a three week stay in which we intended to find an apartment together in his city and then soon completely move me here i have bpd i have been open with him about it since probably the first day we met that s not to say i ve had it under control and been an okay person though for probably a 6 8 month period total not consecutive i wa without a doubt abusive i panicked and became manipulative i wa controlling i would threaten to kill myself love bomb apology and promise the work early this summer i acknowledged all of my horrible behavior apologized and committed to becoming better more stable and not abusive partly for personal growth and partly to salvage the relationship my boyfriend wanted to stay together and try to make it work also he forgave me wa happy i wa trying to get better and he essentially agreed to give me another chance i guess i have not wavered on my commitment and have been successful with dialectical behavior therapy and i have not resorted to any of the tactic or behavior that him and i mutually acknowledged were abusive and not acceptable now i am berated and insulted almost daily when we have the tiniest disagreement he refuse to listen to me speak and all but demand i give up and agree with him if i try to talk to him about anything serious he immediately becomes angry and tell me that i promised to not make him deal with my b anymore it seems like he is only ever either happy content or extremely and uncontrollably angry last night he became angry over a small issue and demanded i get out of his house even though i am state away from my home and he is the only person i know here i obliged and left started walking down the road toward the closest motel about ten minute later he pull up to me and tell me to get in his car i obliged he apologizes then say he want to talk i tried to tell him that him kicking me out of his house so suddenly made me feel like i wasn t in a safe environment he then start repeating you don t feel safe around me until he s pretty much yelling and then he kick me out of his car he later come back and apologizes again we go to his house he sleep and i stay awake all night i know that this can t be okay for him to do but it feel unfair to have been the abusive one at one point and not take it i feel like i deserve it like i earned it like maybe he s just taking out pent frustration from my abuse and maybe it will pas but either way doesn t he deserve the chance he gave me to salvage our relationship from my behavior i don t know how to bring this up to him when i try to speak to him he becomes immediately angry and i am afraid of his reaction i have started to just shut down and that seems to make him more mad i don t even know what i m looking for here advice help just to vent if anybody actually read this stupid novel i just typed on my phone you re amazing and i am sorry to all of the victim out there i deeply regret my abusive behavior i still feel very guilty and ashamed over it i have no excuse for myself i am just deeply apologetic to him for what i did throughout our relationship and to every person suffering through the same thing right now,1

my bf 26 m an experienced snowboarder convinced me 23 f a beginner to go down a mountain i wasn t ready for and threw a tantrum when i couldn t go any further my boyfriend and i took our first snowboarding trip together this weekend we ve been together 3 5 month i am a new snowboarder and prior to this trip had never ridden before not even on ski my bf however wa a snowboarding instructor in high school and college and is very good at it before the trip my bf suggested i start with skiing a it ll be easier to pick up and that way we can have more fun together and i won t spend the day falling on my as but i m stubborn and insisted that snowboarding wa what i wanted to do i bought all my own gear including my board he helped me pick out quality beginner item and my season pas the plan wa for me to stay on the bunny slope while he went and did his own thing but when we got there he say he s going to give me a 30 min lesson first so we go to the bunny slope at the top of the mountain and he start giving me pointer he leaf to go do his own thing and then come back to teach me a bit more and then he say it s time to go down the mountain to eat lunch i tell him i ll take the lift and meet him at the bottom and he call me a pussy and say i can t give up now and that i can t take the lift anyway because it only go up not down i believed him because i d never been on a mountain before and had no idea how the lift worked and later learned that wa a lie he say i need the practice and that i can make it down on the green slope because it s made for beginner i told him multiple time that i wasn t skilled enough and certainly not confident enough to go down it yet but his taunting got the better of me and i went for it it took u 3 hour to get down the mountain i kept falling every few foot and eventually he wa having to hold my hand and help me down because my entire body wa shaking from exhaustion and wouldn t allow me to stay upright on my own my head wa throbbing i wa constantly out of breath and my knee kept giving out i would tell him this and that i just wanted to walk the rest of the way down and he would tell me no you have to practice or you re never going to get better stop giving up i d tell him i m not giving up my body is and he d tell me to stop making excuse and keep going he would point at other girl younger than me riding down and say if they can do it so can you but then he started getting frustrated it wa getting late and he wa tired from having to hold me up and snowboard with 1 foot out of the binding he d start yelling and saying he s not mad at me he s mad at himself for thinking i wa capable of knowing how to snowboard so i told him to just loop back around and by the time he get down again i ll be at the lift so he doe and i meet him at the lift at this point he s fuming because he tried calling me 3 time i didn t answer because i had glove on and wa carrying my board and then when i called him back his pas flew out of his pocket whilst attempting to get his phone out he tell me i m the slowest learner he s ever met and that he s never boarding with me again he s going to leave me at the bunny slope next time he also said i wa too out of shape and needed to start doing cardio i honestly wanted to cry so bad going down that mountain but i ve never cried in front of him before and i already felt like such a failure for not being able to make it down on my own i m embarrassed that i did so poorly but i m also angry because i told him before we even started going down that i just wasn t ready when we get home he tell me that we took a wrong turn on the way down and ended up on a blue slope intermediate but that he didn t want to tell me at the time because he knew i d freak out he apologized for being testy and say that he didn t mean to take any of it out on me but the apology just felt hollow he made me feel like absolute trash for not being able to do something i think most beginner snowboarder wouldn t be able to do either and i can tell he s disappointed in me and on top of that when his friend would ask u how the trip went he s say it wa just alright because he didn t get to do any snowboarding of his own it make me feel like shit that i ruined this trip but is it really my fault should i let this go since he s apologized or should i let him know that he seriously hurt my feeling that day should i also be taking this a a red flag tl dr my bf an experienced snowboarder convinced me to go down a mountain i wasn t ready for and threw a tantrum when i couldn t go any further,0
i 35f feel that my broke friend 35f ha been expecting me to pay for her meal drink i am unsure of how to deal with an uncomfortable situation i find myself in and i would value other people s insight into this i 35f moved to this town about a year ago for my job i m extremely introverted and i often find myself drained after a full day of being in the office i don t get out to socialize much but now that i m settled in i ve been making more of an effort to get out to meetup group to make friend this past summer i met a friend 35f that i clicked with over the last few month we ve gotten pretty close she quickly introduced me to her friend group a well and it s been nice to have a small group of girlfriend a i miss mine back in my old city i m aware that my friend is not financially in the best place she work in maintenance and she s frequently discussed her financial woe a her friend i m happy to listen to her vent i think her other friend are aware a well although none of u have talked with each other about this i think there s some kind of an unspoken understanding for example when 4 of u go out to eat and share 3 appetizer we will do separate check but someone will typically suggest that amy karen and sue random name can each put an appetizer on their check so we each pay for our meal shared appetizer plate whereas my friend the broke one just pay for her meal or if someone mention a restaurant to try someone else will just mention a more affordable place we can go to that serf a similar kind of food and or place they ve seen coupon deal for we ve also lately not been doing dinner but meeting up at cafe which is more affordable big emphasis on affordability and deal i am not wealthy but i am comfortable i have a decent salary some retirement and have plan to buy a house soon almost at my saving goal for my down payment i wa financially not stable when i wa in college so i understand what it s like to be broke i actually worked in maintenance to put myself through college which is how i initially bonded with my friend i don t come from money and i worked my off to get to where i am i had to be really frugal and strict with my budget and i worked a lot during college my time wa evenly split between class and working 30 40 hour a week and i often did not get enough sleep much le have time for a social life to be able to make end meet although i am a lot more comfortable than i used to be i still live pretty frugally i often wait month sometimes year before buying something i want and my first stop is always goodwill or ebay after i first spend a lot of time saving up for something i want here s the dilemma i find myself in during the last two week i can t help but feel that my friend may have been trying to take advantage of me at time by setting me up to pay for her meal drink or ticket for example we went out to a bar that wa charging a cover because they had live music stand up comedy that night usually the cover is only 10 on live music comedy night i didn t have cash so she said she could pay in cash and i could venmo her later on she requested i pay her 20 i told her i thought it wa only 10 but she looked me in the eye and said they were 20 each i paid her although later on it wa confirmed that they were only 10 since 10 is not going to make or break the bank i let that one pas and decided to give her the benefit of doubt we met for brunch last weekend with an extended group of about 20 people the brunch wa hosted by her friend with whom i am acquainted with but not that close with honestly my wallet wa hurting a bit a i had just spent a bunch of money on early christmas shopping i also wake up early even on the weekend so i ate beforehand and just had a regular coffee amp light pastry total wa 4 50 it wa a casual cafe amp there were several other people that also just had something small while some people ordered full meal prior to ordering my friend mentioned she had to leave early for a nephew s birthday when the host mentioned we would be doing one check and we can just pay via venmo paypal etc my friend suggested that i venmo her 6 this wa after i ordered and she can just venmo the host for both of u that way it would be easier for the host to just get one payment instead of two separate payment she then announced to everyone around u that we were paying together my friend ordered a full meal a fancy cappuccino total wa about 16 50 but she left early without paying when the time to split the bill came around the host shared her number and i just paid the host since my friend wasn t there to do her suggested plan where i send my friend cash and she sends the host money for both of u i sent the host 10 for my meal 4 50 tax tip a few dollar extra i also noted on the venmo what item on the receipt were mine the host asked if i wa paying for my friend a well i wa surprised the host asked and put on the spot like that i responded i don t think so she said she would venmo you this is technically true a my friend originally said that she would venmo the host for both of u the host looked pissed and didn t say anything else to me the people next to me also looked uncomfortable in hindsight i realized this wa because my friend had previously announced that we were paying together afterwards i felt crappy about the entire situation like i should ve offered to pay for my friend or something although i empathize with my friend i don t feel that i should have to pick up her tab i m not her mom and frankly if i had a kid in their mid 30 in my friend s situation the most i would do for them is to maybe pay for them to meet with a financial advisor to help keep them on track honestly if my friend were just upfront and said hey i m in a rough patch can you spot me 10 for the cover or hey i m a little tight on cash because of christmas shopping can you get brunch this time and i ll get it next time i would ve been fine it s just the way she did it felt shady and i feel like she s lost credibility in my eye although i can t tell if i m just being too harsh i also can t tell if i m projecting when i wa younger i had been taken advantage of by a friend for example when i turned 21 i didn t handle my liquor a well a i do now and i got wasted when i went out with my friend one of which wa my roommate my roommate went through my wallet when she thought i wa passed out i wa legit drunk but i wa still awake and saw what she wa doing this friend reminds me of that situation so i don t know if i m projecting it just stir up a lot of anger inside of me also if she s that broke why did she eat such an expensive meal why didn t she just get a coffee and a bagel or something also a lot of people have second job i also have a side job i do private tutoring a few hour a week to supplement my income i don t need to but it s easy and i use the tutoring income a extra fun money so why doesn t she just get a second job she ha the time she go about 5 evening a week to the gym because her goal is to get hot if her financial situation is that dire wouldnt it make more sense to use that time to work a second job there s a lot of seasonal job right now now i feel like i m just being judgy at this point i ve kinda cooled off on the friendship i honestly thought we would become really good friend but i m having some doubt now i like the friend she s introduced me to but i m not that desperate for friendship that i would have to pay for a friend tab to hang out with her id rather be alone than have a friend that expects me to pay for her tldr my friend is broke i m not wealthy but i m comfortable i m aware of my friend s ongoing financial situation but i don t feel that i should have to pay her tab am i a scrooge or is this person trying to take advantage of me,0

my 27m wife 26f had affair with married coworker m30 and i want to tell his wife 30 tl dr my wife had a an affair with a married coworker i want to tell his wife partly out of sympathy for her partly out of revenge against him basically i opened my wife s laptop while she wa at work and her imessages from the day came through she and a co worker were constantly flirting through out the day and meeting several time to kiss in his office at that point i done some digging before confronting her and am convinced it wa no more than kissing and lasted under 2 week however a few of his message were more sinister and i am convinced he had intention to take thing further we are managing and i am confident we will get through this none the le it ha ruined me emotionally i have developed anxiety and depression seeing a therapist and moved job to help cope half of me feel guilty for his wife i wanted to tell her from the start but held off to try and keep the emotion out of the decision i can t get away from the thought my own anxiety of not knowing and how she would feel it eating away at me however i think the other half is probably just revenge he ha suffered no repercussion from it which also eats away at me i know that s not healthy but i don t want these thought to consume me at his expense i feel like i am the only one shouldering the burden in this whole situation additionally i am concerned telling his wife will cause problem and undo the healing me and my wife have been working on the past month i just don t know what to do,0
how did you bring up your abusive past in future relationship i got out of a two year plus relationship about a month and a half ago i didn t even realize he wa abusive until the night i left it still wasn t that bad compared to many of the story i have read on here he would simply explode on me every four or five month we were together the rest of the time wa so great and i completely adored him never hit me and never even raised his voice that much he would just say extremely disparaging thing about me usually in a menacing quiet voice break up with me and then the next day hug me and pretend it never happened i do think he wa starting to test the boundary with some lite physical stuff a well it wa just done in a kind of almost sneaky way that make me question if it wa intentional or not anyway my question is this i m trying to move on i m 29 f so a bit more focused on finding a life partner than i wa a few year ago and honestly i thought my ex wa it but i m struggling a bit i wa always very confident before i m not now my ex said that he didn t think i wa smart enough to be successful in life that i wa lazy shallow etc he asked me to list for him what i had to offer besides being pretty he basically implied that i fooled him into thinking i wa worth dating because of my prettiness but there wa actually nothing under the surface he said i wa dumb and a hopeless case his main thesis about me seemed to be i couldn t function well at being a normal money making adult which ha always been my insecurity anyway given i am a drumroll struggling actor and my parent have helped me out from time to time i have a pretty good job making okay money but i worry i m not an attractive dating option for economic reason anyways two thing i can sense there is new interest on the horizon which i am into i definitely want to get back out there but i have this insecurity now that men are drawn in by thinking i m cute and once they find out who i really am a my ex did they will jet and go for someone with substance also when in the dating process do i bring up this issue of my ex i feel like bringing it up too soon will cause weird pressure or could be a manipulative tactic of it s own i don t want to weird anyone out but i also know the way he treated me wa totally unacceptable and i m a little fucked up from it so when i am ready to date and the oh my ex convos start happening how do i handle this and i just also wanted to say if you are creeping on this thread bc of your own reason you are amazing don t let anyone ever tell you otherwise,1

husband 30m and i 28f at an impasse about splitting finance with income disparity my husband 30m and i 28f have been married for 2 year dating for 3 5 year when we dated and married we were making about the same amount of money and unfortunately division of finance in the event that one of u made more wa never really discussed we did decide to keep our finance mostly separate and just split all household bill and rent 50 50 my husband got a new job about a year ago and received a promotion a well and i have been at the same job since we were married i make 17 an hour and he now make 23 an hour which mean that he make 35 more than me he ha been able to save a lot of money a well a buy himself some nice thing and start saving for retirement while i have struggled to scrape together any saving a couple of day ago he mentioned that he wa buying himself a new computer and he mentioned the amount of saving he had accrued and it blew my mind that he had so much and i had so little and i brought up that i felt that the way we were splitting finance 50 50 when he is making 35 more than me is unfair and that it put me at a disadvantage when considering my financial safety and future i suggested splitting finance based on our comparative income but he is adamantly against this and said it would be like him paying for his wife and that he would never ask the same of me this come at an inopportune moment because i am currently looking for a better paying job and he think that this issue is coming up because i don t want to look for a job and want to rely on him to pay for our lifestyle which is not the case in just the past two day an issue that wa not even on either of our radar ha suddenly completely rocked the boat in our marriage and i am now even thinking of separating over this even if i do find a better paying job it isn t guaranteed that we will always make the same amount of money and i don t think i can live all of my life with a partner if i don t feel like we are investing in the same way in our shared financial future my husband think that by one person paying more they are in fact investing more and that that would be unfair on the higher earner i brought up moving to a smaller place but he said and he is correct that if i were living on my own i would pay the same for a studio a i am paying now a 50 of our larger apartment and that moving to a smaller place would save each of u le than 100 a month since we already live in a cheap place i am asking for suggestion to try to explain to him my point of view on splitting finance or if others with his view could help me understand how his point of view is more fair the way thing are right now one of u will have to make a big concession and i am afraid that person will grow resentful or we will split up over this issue tl dr husband making more money than wife but neither is agreed about fairness of splitting finance either 50 50 or based on income,0

my 27f fiance 27m want u live separately for a while he ha a good reason and i appreciate that but i can t shake the feeling he wa just using me lot to unload here so i ll go chronologically we went to the same high school and became best friend in our final year we were 2 ethnic people in a town with not much diversity the same kind of girl that bullied me for my ethnicity were throwing themselves at him our friendship helped me open up to other people and to stand up for myself and i will be forever grateful for that we went to the same uni i kept living at home his home life wasn t the greatest and he would shack up with whatever girl he dated he jumped from relationship to relationship during uni he wa single for a total of 2 week we graduated eventually i got my own place and had few relationship behind me he kept shacking up with random girl over the year i realized i m in love with him but i valued our friendship over a relationship that would most likely fail amp x200b some 2 year ago my ex cheated on me and i kicked him out i couldn t afford living alone in that house and i wa looking for a roommate his relationship fell apart around the same time and he moved in with me we were already inseparable but living together only made our friendship stronger he stopped fucking around and he wa single for month last september we threw a party we got pretty hammered and he got depressed when everyone left he said that a girl like me would never date someone like him he ll never have a meaningful relationship and probably die alone i asked him why a girl like me but not me we finally opened up about our feeling and that s how our relationship started he wa the perfect boyfriend and all those year of friendship taught u to communicate there s nothing we couldn t resolve with an open conversation and we never fought amp x200b that year around christmas he wa hit by a car he wa badly injured had 8 surgery spent 2 month in a hospital and got discharged to a recovery facility he wa losing his mind and i took him home he wa bedridden we couldn t afford a full time caregiver so i started working from home and only got to leave the house when the pt or a friend would come over it wa a hard time for him and he would lash out at anyone but me he proposed a soon a he wa back on his foot since then he regained full mobility found new interest and hobby and a better job he had ground to sue the city and eventually got a hefty settlement he got the money almost 2 month ago and instantly changed he got quiet lost in his thought and he wasn t a dedicated and attentive a he used to be i wa begging him to talk to someone almost dying and being immobile for 6 month is sure to leave a mark and a lot of unresolved feeling he agreed to couple counseling cause he wa worried about the mark that left on me amp x200b he finally opened up 2 week ago he said that he doesn t know himself cause he always molded his personality to the person he wa with he said that he wa his true self only around me but after we started a relationship he wasn t sure if he came to his own or became a better person because he wa with me he said he still want to be with me but also want to try living alone for the first time in his life he wa completely dependent on others for 6 month and this made sense at the time when we got home he said he will find a place in my area so we can still carpool we will go on more date and most likely we ll still be spending every night together only this time i can come to his place he started looking for a place and last week he randomly asked me what i think about a house on sale he started showing me other house he wa looking at and none of them were rental he said it s a good investment for our future once he move back in with me we can rent it out etc it went from i need to live alone for few month but i ll probably come back in a week to i m buying my own place amp x200b the timing of it all hit me and i lost it i stared thinking about myself for the first time since his accident we had our first fight almost a year and a half into the relationship i wa still paying for my house and i couldn t live in it with a single income besides i couldn t work the full 40 hour while caring for him which made my financial situation even more terrible yes when i bought the house i wa fully aware i will need a roommate but it s not that hard to find one in an university town now i m engaged and i have to airbnb the spare bedroom cause my live in fiance want to live alone for an undecided period of time i realized we ve been engaged for 4 month we said we wouldn t rush to get married but we never once talked about the wedding now he said really he want to marry me but not yet he want to spend the rest of his life with me but he proposed when he did out of gratitude he spent 6 month in bed he had all the time in the world for soul searching but he didn t start thinking about living alone until he got the money he didn t outright say he want to buy a house he told me that only after i accepted living apart for a while he spent year shacking up with random girl to get away from home then he shacked up with me how wa i different then i became his caregiver at the very start of our relationship and he proposed cause he wa feeling grateful now he got his hand on some money and want to leave me on my own after caring for him left me in an even deeper financial hole i don t regret wiping his as for 4 month but i sure do feel bitter and used amp x200b i called off the engagement said i think i still want to be with him but i don t want to marry him yet told him to propose again when he really mean it and this time with a ring yes he got an ungodly amount of money almost 2 month ago and i still don t have a ring we spent the night in separate room and he wa walking on eggshell for few day didn t mention moving out once last night we finally had sex laughed and cuddled this morning he brought me breakfast in bed and then i found him looking at listing again a soon a he made sure he hasn t lost me my blood boiled i already agreed to living separately for a while cause i think he really need that i even realized that him buying a house is a smart decision then we had a fight he pretended he didn t say any of those thing and started looking at listing again a soon a i calmed down it s insulting i went to a friend place to avoid another fight i want to be able to think clearly about the future of our relationship we were best friend for a decade had the perfect partnership for over a year and it all might end just like that now i feel both used and manipulated i thought we could talk openly about everything but this time he manipulated me into accepting his wish instead of straight out telling me what he want and need amp x200b tldr my best friend since high school came from an abusive household and kept shacking up with girl he knew for a week to get away from home 2 year ago i needed a roommate cause the house payment were killing me and he moved in with me eventually we started dating 4 month into the relationship he wa hit by a drunk driver and spent 2 month in the hospital and 4 more month bedridden at home i became his caregiver he proposed right after he got back on his foot he had ground to sue the city 2 month ago he got the money from the settlement and only then realized he s never lived alone and need to find himself he wa completely dependent on others for 6 month and this made sense to me so i agreed the plan wa to stay together but live apart for few week month only after i accepted that he told me he want to buy a house and we had our first fight in year and a half he told me he proposed cause he felt grateful but doesn t want to get married yet so i called off the engagement he wa walking on eggshell for day being the perfect boyfriend and started looking at listing a soon a i calmed down and thing went back to normal even tho i had already agreed to all that my blood randomly boiled and i left my own house to be able to think clearly i feel used and manipulated and i want to break up with him i thought we knew how to communicate but apparently that s not the case he used a third party a a crutch while breaking the news and then manipulated me into accepting more and more thing how am i different than all the other girl he shacked up with when he had nowhere to go,0

my 26f boyfriend 28m just gave me an extremely special and valuable gift but i feel really bad about it so my boyfriend isn t going to be here for christmas so we decided to do our gift exchange yesterday we decided not to go overboard with each other because we are saving up to put a deposit down have a few month rent and some money for some furniture so that we can get into a nice place together in the summer we both currently live at home in similar situation both to be around to help our parent out and to live for a reduced rent to save up we have been dating for 5 year so we had a 200 dollar budget on eachother i got him a new gaming headset and a few little trinket and he got me some t shirt a new pair of jean and a pair of riding boot for my horse really normal awesome gift but then he pulled out one more present for me it wa a diamond necklace it belonged to his grandmother who passed away in july i wa a little taken aback because we had agreed to keep it small but he assured me it wa within our rule because he didn t pay for it he inherited it he is a smarta lol but it is such an indescribably special memento to their family that i immediately felt extremely guilty he wa giving it to me he said that he wanted to gift it to me because he intends on spending the rest of his life with me and it wa basically almost like a promise ring but necklace form i know that sound kind of juvenile or silly but i m not sure how else to describe it it kind of felt like a symbol that he intended on proposing in the next little while he wanted something really special to show me how he felt it s not that i m ungrateful that he gave it to me or anything it is drop dead stunningly beautiful it s just that i honestly feel like he shouldn t have given it to me just because of the value it hold in their family i m worried that he rushed that decision and he might regret it i m having a hard time articulating exactly why it make me feel uncomfortable but to be totally honest it doe i don t know how to balance not wanting to come across a i m grateful but processing the feeling that i feel about getting this necklace i would really appreciate some insight into whether or not i m overthinking this what i should be reflecting on in my own feeling or if there s anything i should specifically be telling him about this i definitely cried a lot and it s the most special and beautiful thing that i now own but it just feel almost wrong am i overthinking of course i would absolutely without a doubt return it if we broke up even if he hit my dog with a car and stole my identity i would return it to his mom it s not that i m worried about him regretting it if we break up or anything because giving it back would be the first thing i would do but just overall i don t want anyone to feel any resentment towards me for having this because if i m being totally honest i didn t even know his grandma it feel like such a frustrating situation to try to put into word because i feel like the whole thing make me look horribly ungrateful what should i do tl dr my boyfriend gifted me a beautiful family heirloom for christmas but i worry that he will regret giving it to somebody that isn t in their direct family,0

my 24m exgf 24f of 4 year broken up 2 year thought i cheated on her and now realizes i didn t so the recap is my ex and i met and started to date when we started college we moved in together after two year after four year together she caught me cheating on her because her friend sent her a video of me making out with another girl except it wasn t me at all and to this day i cannot for the life of me imagine why would anyone pretend it look like me in this video because i had learned to know her honesty and of how shocked she wa i trust that she did think she wa seeing me in that video she wanted me to confess what i did and what i truly wanted and try to make it work but you know continuing to say that wasn t me didn t work for her i guess if you look at it from the eye of someone who doe think they were cheated on it make perfect sense without a confession from me she broke up with me and frankly i wouldn t have wanted either of u to stay stuck like that the breakup wa two year ago just this week she started texting me again after complete mutual silence to talk about the video she wa asking when it wa made and i told her again that video wa unrelated to me and i had no idea when it wa taken knew where because i recognized the place she told me like she found when it wa made and it wa before we met no chance at all i could have looked like an adult like that before we met and you know been in a place with drink for adult she started to ask why i didn t tell her about all the thing that made it impossible i cheated on her i mean that s not even me in this video if your eye work what else wa there to say i am unsure of what s the courtesy to do here shall i discus in length what could have been done what could have been analyzed with this situation it s not like i resent her so if we could get some closure we newly found out could be had i could get along with it she s speaking of getting back together though which i told her i m not interested in i wa in another relationship when she texted back who s reproaching me to not have said no fast enough when she asked to get back together that s an ironical twist but i guess there s nothing to do about that anymore i d rather not give that newly ex the impression that i m shamelessly enjoying the attention of my older ex i just think she s a person who went through a bad time and who may have a right to talk in depth about what happened tl dr ex broke up with me two year ago because she thought i wa cheating on her i didn t now she s realizing i didn t but she s a bit accusatory that i wasn t trying hard to defend myself and she s demanding we talk about what happened to u and what could have been done i m not sure what s the courtesy rule on that,0
i m lost and feel trapped and stuck i ve never really posted about this and i ve been on this sub for about 2 month now reading other people s post ha helped me with some stuff but here it is so about 2 month ago i broke up with my fiancee at the time we were together for two year and during these two year the good time wa really good but when it got bad it wa really bad we would have a small argument and she would all i can explain it a is seeing red and she would hit me pull my hair and just hurt me i always looked past it and i don t know why we were meant to get married on the 15 07 2019 but i called it off about 2 week before and then had to leave about a week before the date of the wedding we lived ina house together and she just snapped again one day and i had enough so i left and got out of there it wa heart breaking we had a dog and i had to leave him but recently we started talking again and we said we would date but that quickly turned into a relationship and now i feel trapped again i can t get past what ha happened and i m just not happy but why do i still feel trapped and this whole time i could have said no and i have not,1
my 24f boyfriend 25m told me that i m chastising him to the point that it is seriously affecting his self esteem meanwhile i don t know how to hold him accountable for anything i have been with my boyfriend for a bit over 2 year and i consider him to be a really gentle and kind person we share a lot of interest and also have similar family background which mean that we get along quite well we can spend whole evening being silly and laughing together but for the last year of our relationship i have gently and then not so gently asked him to do thing that i would consider basic thing that you do in a relationship when you respect the other person but nothing ha changed in the beginning i had a million and one excuse for him he is forgetful he really doe care but he wasn t raised to pay attention to these thing he just focus on other thing and then maybe he ha adhd maybe he deal with issue through avoidance eventually i have gotten to the point where i feel that i have no other choice but to think that he doe not care for respect me and this ha caused me to shut down emotionally and have a lot of resentment over time i have also developed an unhealthy behavior of dealing with his forgetfulness avoidance lack of organization and messiness by constantly asking him and reminding him to do thing it s not how i want to deal with this and i ve never been a nagger in any other of my long term relationship but i don t know what else to do i have tried talking with him calmly outside of the situation getting to the root cause anxiety and asking him to see a therapist i ve broken down and explained how thing affect me i ve tried to issue ultimatum i ve shut down and tried to ignore it but all of these tactic create resentment and over time when thing stay the same despite me trying all of these strategy i just feel unloved and start to hate the person i have become i m not the only one who is frustrated about these thing our housemate his mom his friend they all joke about how he doe thing last minute ha a tendency to disappear to say he will do something and just not do it and so on so it s not in my head last night we were having a typical night where we start cooking dinner our other housemate start looking into the sink and see that there is cereal in the drain and asks why it s there i remember that this morning i had to run to a job interview and my boyfriend said to go and that he would clean up then when i came back i saw a bunch of the cereal in the sink and i too asked the same question he told me that he didn t know where else to put it i asked what i wa supposed to do to take it out with my hand he replied that no he would take care of it and emptied it out into the trash meanwhile having it drip all over the kitchen floor which again i remarked on and that annoyed him later in the evening it seems that he cleaned out the rest of the bowl and there wa more cereal down the drain again to our housemate s annoyance of course it being my cereal i consider it my duty to clean up after myself but at the same time he said he would do it and the way that he did do it is symptomatic of this kind of behavior in our relationship the evening then went on like some evening where thing start to snowball i m cooking and i ask him to clean put thing away while i m doing something else i ask him to set the table when he set the table without cleaning it first i also ask him to clean the table i forget what wa the exact trigger but after dinner he got upset about the fact that i wa constantly telling him what to do even though he wa already doing it he ha gotten a bit better with these thing but i feel like now because of all this time my automatic reaction is that he won t think of doing something unless i tell him to and i had resigned myself to that he ended up telling me that me chastising and belittling him have made his self esteem really plummet to the point where when he is alone he act out according to these belief that i have inserted for example that he is stupid and forgetful is an alcoholic and is irresponsible this is to the point that when i left for a week long holiday with my family he admitted to drinking every night going to sleep at 3am and turning the room into a huge mess now i have never insulted him and i do not think these thing any time i have brought up a concern i frame it according to what bother me however i understand how these constant comment would make him believe these thing and it make me really upset that this may be what is happening i promised to not bring these thing up anymore but i m afraid that i won t be able to stand it if the behavior continue regardless there are several other issue impacted by this since the beginning of our relationship we have argued over sleep and bedtime this seems ridiculous and it honestly is sometimes i still don t understand why we cannot seem to resolve this at the beginning it wa in a romantic sense we were travelling together and he wanted to go have drink and stay out late with me whenever after a few day i would bring up that i wa tried and wanted to go to sleep earlier this really bothered him and he would try to convince me to stay out then over the course of our relationship he ha increasingly interrupted my sleep schedule he continues to minimize my need for sleep and we have argued many time over when and how i should turn off the light he considers when i turn off the light that i am being rude and in the past ha told me that he should be allowed to hang out in the room with the light on late into the night because that is how he relaxes i ve tried to get him to at least do his hanging out which he usually doe until 12 30 2am in the living room we had multiple conversation about a light out time at 11pm but even then i feel like i have to remind him and follow up on it every evening hey i m going to sleep soon i will be turning off the light even when he chill outside of the bedroom he would come into the room and turn on the light look for his belonging and make noise which i found to be really rude after a lot of arguing he finally relented and is now trying not to make noise but he still play loud music into the night and thing of this nature i feel like i am constantly picking up after him the almost daily thing include sock empty plastic bottle cigarette filter plastic those end up everywhere plastic wrapper and so on he ha gotten better on this front to some degree he will turn on and empty the dishwasher organize the wardrobe do a deep clean and so on but sometimes the daily thing just add up for example he will do the dish after cooking but not clean the counter or the hob or some of the food he said he would put away this ha also affected our sex life a many other woman the more i feel i have to mother him the more i lose my sex drive his solution to break down this toxic dynamic is that i should write thing down whenever he doe something that annoys me in his mind these type of event are symptomatic of me getting into a certain mood and criticizing him because he is the person that is around and i have control over i am really upset that after all this time of me adapting to his behavior and trying to communicate about this he is essentially telling me that i have becoming a bully due to my own issue of course i agree that sometimes i get too annoyed but i have never gotten annoyed about thing that i haven t brought up x time before i am willing to review my behavior and in fact throughout my relationship i have gotten back to therapy several time to make sure that my emotional trigger are not causing these kind of argument however at this point i feel that i have done everything i can and unless we go to couple counselling something i have already offered but he ha not taken me up on i don t know if this dynamic will change i m sorry that this post is just me venting and complaining i am sad that i feel like this and i know it can be frustrating but i just don t know how to talk about this anymore ha this gotten too toxic are we just incompatible how can he say he love me and not listen to my concern have i destroyed his self esteem how do i fix this am i just asking him to do thing he isn t capable of are my expectation too high am i approaching this in the wrong way i feel like i have tried everything tl dr my boyfriend and i can t seem to agree on what to expect in a relationship what level of cleanliness and organization is acceptable and how to deal with disagreement to do with our lifestyle i have tried to address these issue in many way but have resigned myself to just dealing with it however that ha turned me into a nagger in the house and making him have bad self esteem this make him act out when he is alone what do i do thank you,0

my 26f roommate 28f parent 70 m f have been living with u for 2 month my roommate s parent have been staying with u for two month and i am annoyed some background we share a two bedroom apartment in a major city we had not met before moving in together but a friend of a friend introduced u we have generally made really good roommate we talked on the phone once before moving in and she mentioned that her parent would sometimes come stay with her for large chunk of time about a month they are from southeast asia and speak very little english she said that this happened before in her last place and that they were very respectful of her roommate and would mostly keep to themselves they are in our city to take care of medical issue green card application stuff and see friend they arrived at my apartment two month ago and there have been some issue they cook a lot and have taken over the fridge so i can t put any of my own food in the fridge i haven t gone grocery shopping in two month they sometimes cook for me but when they do there is no warning and they get very offended if i don t eat their food the have never told me they ll be cooking for me beforehand i just come home and they tell me my dinner is ready even if i ve already eaten or have made other plan they will say we made this for you specifically and take offense if i don t eat another issue is that they ve commandeered the kitchen including our sink because of the language barrier it is near impossible to get across that i don t want them to wash my dish i know this seems like a silly problem but they washed my cast iron pan which destroyed it despite me telling them not to wash it they have said several time that i am their second daughter and they want me to feel like they are my uncle and auntie but i would never be able to talk to them like parent and i will always be respectful they are houseguest to me not family they are generally respectful of my use of the house for example if they re watching tv they ll ask if i want the tv however i never tell them to leave because i feel the need to be respectful i ve never asked them to leave the living room even when they offer i go and watch tv on my computer this is true of the kitchen table and kitchen a well and ha led to me spending all my time in my room unless they re not home since they don t work they re often home during the day part of my job involves working from home and i have been unable to use my space a i d like to for my job i know my roommate is annoyed at their presence a well the three of them are sharing her bedroom and they ve been spending nearly every waking moment together for the past two month but because she feel like they ve been inconveniencing her she think they haven t inconvenienced me it s especially difficult to talk to her about this because they re always in our apartment so we haven t had a moment to discus this alone the final straw wa last night i tried to bring someone home and her parent were sitting in the living room a we entered obviously my date left and i can t blame him he felt massively uncomfortable knowing my roommate s parent were there i get it my roommate feel the same way she asked her parent to leave so her boyfriend could stay for a week she s aware of the inconvenience but doesn t seem to think it impact me i have been very chill about this and not complained until now perhaps i should have because now i feel like i don t have any leverage since i ve tacitly allowed the situation to persist last week i asked if they might be amenable to paying a third of our rent for the month they stayed longer than even my roommate expected plus her boyfriend is coming for a week which will be over two month of continuous houseguest they ve been paying our electric bill 150 month and i don t think money is an issue for them i think it s largely a cultural choice that they chose to stay with her instead of an airbnb or a hotel my roommate got upset that i asked them to chip in for rent and aggressively said no that i had agreed to this and that it wa an unfair ask since a she said they have been sharing her space not mine so the question how do i tell her that i didn t understand how it would be that they re essentially third and forth roommate who don t pay rent that the fact that they re respectful doesn t mean they haven t taken up space thankfully they now have an end date and are leaving soon is it even worth it to bring this up or should i let it go and find a new roommate when my lease is up early next summer it s possible that they will visit again any advice would be so appreciated,0

am i in an abusive relationship i am in a relationship with my girlfriend for 2 year now and i really think i m being emotionally abused and sometimes it even get physical i want your opinion if i am or not in an abusive relationship and if so what should i do about it let me start from the beginning we met through a common female friend we had in mid winter we went out with that same friend 3 4 time until suddenly one day we started kissing at a bar we were all together at i guess that s when we began dating at the beginning thing were great she wa really sweet and kind all the time not complaining or trying to control me in any way but i kept feeling like she wa being kinda cold and distant thing were all good and fun until a day at the club i lost my cousin in a car accident about 4 month before that day and i wa drunk at the club and started cry on some song that reminded me of her our common friend saw me cry and got really close to me and hugged me pulling her head towards mine when she saw this she pushed her aside hugged me and started cry i wa confused because i didn t know the reason she did that we then packed our thing and went down to the car to go home she kept on cry in the car and told me that she thought for a long time now that me and her friend were flirting and we were both attracted to each other which made her really jealous i even saw some message she sent another friend of hers talking bad about her friend and saying thing like if she go sit next to him again i m gonna beat her up one day me her her friend and some friend of mine went to a latin night at a bar i m not the guy who dance i mostly sit down and enjoy my drink but her friend knew how to dance latin and picked me up from the table and we danced for a minute or 2 after that 20 30 minute later she got up we went outside to smoke and told me she wa tired and wanted to go home to get some sleep she left and we spoke the next day about 8 month after that day i found out that on that night she went to her ex fuck buddy s house which she wa still in love with deeply and spend the night there having sex i had really big issue with my confidence towards that guy because when i met her at the beginning we started dating she kept bragging about how good the previous guy wa how tall he wa how he had big muscle and a nice body how he wa really smart sexy and helped her with her everyday problem by advising her and how calm and quiet he wa a a true man should be and that made me feel insecure and uncomfortable up to this day i m a guy that i believe ha a really pleasant personalty and i always make joke and talk a lot when gathering with friend and family that s just how i am but because i am like this she keep calling me a clown and that i m immature and she doesn t like me like this because this is not how the ideal male is supposed to be the ideal male is supposed to be serious quiet and only talk when he s supposed to for her some month in she had a fight with our common friend confronting her about the club incident and how she thought we were into each other her friend then texted me saying that she wa really sorry that what she wa saying wa not true and that he wanted to clear thing out with me first so that i don t believe she wa ever into me we talked and she stopped talking to my girlfriend that day my girlfriend got really upset because they were friend for year while she wa a friend of mine for only 6 month and started saying thing like she doesn t deserve my friendship when she s interested more in your relationship than our relationship that s where the downfall really began she kept on remembering this subject with her friend and up to this day still think we both were into each other or at least one of u wa she kept on saying i wa a sex addict and a pervert because i wa following 2000 girl i didn t know on instagram before i met her and liked some sexy picture of other girl while we were in the relationship she confronted me and i unfollowed everyone in instagram and facebook i didn t personally know just to please her she then started being a shut in saying thing like i m not the kind of person that like to go out a lot or i m bored when we are out with your friend she wa doing this and wa indirectly demanding that i shouldn t be going out with my friend when she wasn t in the mood of coming with me which she never wa many kind of abusive thing started happening in the middle of our relationship she started being paranoid that i wa talking to other girl she told me she didn t want me going out with my sister because she had many female friend and i could cheat on her she didn t want me going anywhere on saturday or friday night when she didn t want to because i wa going to leave her home alone she also started getting really cold rarely showing affection towards me wa almost always angry and moody and stopped talking to me for day sometimes she didn t want me hanging out with a certain relative of mine she had a fight with and when he sent me to tell me about their fight she had a fight with me because i didn t stand up for her i m a guy that doesn t like fighting with people avoids conflict at all time and would rather keep thing that annoy me about someone deep inside than telling them about it and ruining our relationship that s why she call me two faced and that i never take side and i that i m never true to other people always showing them my good fake self incident like extreme fight that lead her into beating me up physically breaking my car s front glass from the inside because she got mad at me and saying thing like i d rather die than be with you or you are the worst thing that ever happened to me starting happening she started being extremely abusive and possessive towards me restricting me from having any personal space life or free time of mine which when i tried to claim for myself lead to really intense fight she always us the break up weapon towards me having breaking up with me hundred of time most of them leading to me begging her to accept me back while some others with her apologizing to me she s the kind of girl that if she doesn t get her way she ll find a million thing to turn everything upon the other person it s not all bad though i find her pretty smart and sexy she s polite most of the time and know how to behave in public and towards other people she love helping out when someone need it she really love animal like myself and isn t the kind of girl she requires attention from anyone she s independent dress really ethically and would never let any other male talk to her in a way she think he s flirting with her when she is in a relationship she pick the people she trust very carefully but is really loyal towards them she wash my clothes cook for me and many time give me advice when i have personal problem in my life i m not completely innocent myself though and i excuse some of her behavior to some a point i m a guy that is kind of a daydreamer kinda lazy not really responsible many time and sometimes i disregard my personal hygiene which make her correctly mad towards me also at the begging of our relationship i had something called retroactive jealousy which is the irrational jealousy of your partner s sexual past which at the beginning of our relationship i found out that she did thing not that extreme and not that many that were morally unacceptable to me and i sometimes insulted her and confronted her with stuff that she couldn t do anything to change but i realized that and i fought really hard and got over those feeling quite fast so this is some of my story i left many thing out to be a bit concise what do you guy think am i being emotionally abused in my relationship or am i just overacting any kind of advice is welcome,1

i feel i m the abusive one i want to change but i know i should let go of him so the beginning of all this started in november of 2018 me f18 and my boyfriend m18 have been dating for a while now and i realized for a while that maybe we just aren t the best for each other and what i mean by that is that i m the one in the wrong me and my boyfriend weren t always arguing even though i can t remember the last time that we didn t argue nowadays me and him argue almost every day and sometimes i can t see a reason a to why we have these argument during the first five month of u dating i did start seeing these sign of red flag he had always kept speaking of his ex constantly and when i tried to speak about it bothering me he d say something along the line of you re telling me i can t talk about how i feel now i always let you tell me when you re sad and i can t speak about how i feel this would begin petty argument and a a result i had low self confidence whenever we both went out and whenever he spoke of his friend eventually maybe i m just blaming it on him but i felt very insecure with him compared to his multiple friend that were girl i would get angry and constantly ask for validation whenever he spoke of one of his friend body she s so tiny she look so funny cause her body is so small why speak of it to me all the time so eventually i felt completely insecure of myself and would tell him she s very pretty you two seem nice together a a result he d get angry because then he d constantly tell me it s just a joke i just make fun of her cause she s small but all the time and then i ended up getting mad and this entire thing would cause an entire argument because of me i should ve just let it go eventually him speaking of his ex stopped and like thing seemed good although i d be confused all the time and i d have to ask him who he wa talking about are you talking about her again and i guess because i had to constantly ask this he d get angry eventually i just stopped and accepted that he stopped and he did and i m not proud to say this but because of me he unfollowed these girl he d talk to me about but the problem i found here wa that he stayed in the beginning that he always avoided these girl because he s loyal in his relationship which i found weird because well why would you need to stop talking to them eventually i told him to unfollow them and that on my part wa really really ignorant and stupid of me to do i ve noticed it since the beginning i m not sure if it s just the type of person he is but whenever i told him about what i wa feeling if i had a bad day and i felt i needed someone to talk to he d just dismiss it by saying don t think about it it ll get better i m here for you but if i continued talking about what bothered me he d get angry at me for it because i wa going on and on about something that didn t matter or that i wa bothering him because i shouldn t feel that way anyways over the past few month it really did just get worse he d tell me how i should feel if he said something that really hurt my feeling during an argument and he d tell me well you asked for it didn t you don t cry to me because you re doing that to yourself you have no right to feel that way i had introduced him to my parent early on and they thought he wa the sweetest kid ever and they were genuinely happy for me but i feel like i m the monster and at the same time i feel like he hurt me too i m not sure what s going on but i remember telling my parent we wouldn t be seeing him for a while at my house because we had some issue to take care of and he had gotten so angry at me you know your dad meant a lot to me he wa something i wanted a a father figure and you know i never had a dad why would you take that away from me you have your fault in this too it hurt me to see him so sad about that but i could tell he really did enjoy spending time with my father all the time my dad would always teach him something new whether it be cooking or anything else his friend are an entirely different situation maybe i did judge them a lot they weren t really the nicest friend that he told me about they judged me when me and him began going out since one of them knew of my ex boyfriend and they would shit talk about me and my boyfriend would tell me about it constantly they always convinced him to drink or smoke a lot and eventually it d cause a problem between me and him since at time he d rather choose to spend more time doing that than to hang out with me i felt left out and lonely in our relationship eventually he felt that the more i spent time with him the le he got to see his friend but in reality i don t see him too often due to college and he s still in high school so my schedule doesn t let u hang out so it s not like i m always with him anyway and the thing that i wa most afraid of wa him judging me based on my past relationship that really changed me there were so many traumatic event that occurred in that relationship and i trusted him with some of the information but in our argument now he ha all the right to bring up my ex and say that i deserved whatever he did to me but if i spoke even a word of his ex he d threaten to say i could just cheat on you with her if you keep talking about her it s an entire cycle and i feel like i m contributing to the abusive behavior i ve been doing to him a lot and i just don t know what to do it wasn t always like this i m sorry if this is a long post i just needed somewhere to vent,1

should i 17m rat on my sister 17f for vaping my sister used to smoke cigarette until a few month ago when she got caught and dad gave a ton of shit for it there were a few loud fight dad wa kind of ridiculous about it i think and yelled at her a lot for it later she had a pretty chill talk with mom and she asked her why she wa doing it and whether she wa aware that smoking ha no positive and a bunch of negative consequence i haven t seen her smoke ever since not even secretly now she s vaping though which a far a i m aware is not a terrible a regular smoking but it is still far from safe they re still addictive a fuck and still give you a nicotine high she said she wa gonna slap the snitch out of me if i told anyone when she wa vaping around friend in school several week ago which seems odd because it s not like i ve ever snitched on her vaping is also forbidden in school i m not afraid of her and i don t want to snitch but i also don t want her to consume that stuff directly ratting on her seems pretty severe but i think it s clear she doesn t want to listen to me should i just let her be or tell our parent tl dr sister stopped smoking but is now vaping she threatened to slap the snitch out of me if i tell our parent should i tell on her,0

my mother 60 s lied to me and my dad 60 s about my 30 s inheritance and is planning on using it for herself the backstory when i wa a kid my parent bought some mountain property that i consider some of the best property in all of the southeast to put thing into perspective it share a border with the national park service it is extremely high elevation for the appalachian it is the last house on the path to the top and it is situated on a large knoll with 270 view you can literally watch the sunrise and sunset from the house with a backdrop of long range mountain view and you have a 20 minute hike to the top of the mountain from the doorstop along with numerous other hike without ever getting in a car the cabin on the property is not very good it feel like home since it s made from local timber and feel awesome but the kitchen is not modern really i don t care about the house not being some super fancy house with amazing amenity since the point of this place is to get away and be me for my taste a well a my dad s this is irreplaceable my dad wa the driving force behind the purchase and maintenance of this property and he and i share the same view on this this is the kind of property teddy roosevelt would have thought belonged in a national forest and hell it even border one when i wa in high school my parent divorced with my dad keeping this property however since then he needed to retire and simultaneously needed to help his aging parent this led him to consider selling the property long story short he sold the property to my mom under the condition that it really is mine and not hers and she agreed when this happened i wa elated my mom put the property in a trust that i would get in my mid fifty i m in my thirty now but at the point of purchase i wa in my twenty she also agreed that when i wa financially stable enough to afford the upkeep and maintenance of the mountain property without any financial hardship she would dissolve the trust and i would inherit it she did emphasize that she had to believe i wa financially secure enough this made me absolutely ecstatic i got the place of my dream or so i thought i spent a good chunk of money making improvement to the cabin on the property which included a tankless water heater to replace the broken one new stove to replace the open pilot and dangerous old one and finally new toilet to replace the leaky cracked one my mom and her new husband even helped out fund wise for these improvement they chipped in 500 iirc these improvement allowed me to spend time up there with ease and just relax whenever i wanted in addition a few year have passed and i am now married and have gotten several promotion and make considerably more now than i did before my wife is also a professional and ha her own income so i m in great financial shape when i brought this up to my mom and said i would like to dissolve the trust and i have the financial wherewithal to do so i expected her to make me prove it which i am prepared to do but instead i wa just told no it s hers and i ll have to wait a few month later i learn she s seeing an architect and planning on razing the current cabin that i grew up in and building some fancy house so she and her new husband can retire up there i m absolutely crushed i ve tried to build my life around this property a i am in the tech field software developer and can work remotely i had intended on living up there in summer and working remotely more than that i have been using it a a getaway house whenever i m stressed this is all gone now a visiting my cabin and getting away from it all is very different from visiting my mother and her husband again to be clear she is not forbidding me access she s just planning on using it for herself and expecting me to be fine with that and having to visit her instead of the mountain she s also trying to find some middle ground where i can request time and she ll leave which seems like a fair compromise except from my perspective this still involves me visiting her place rather than the mountain and her going back on her word it completely change the entire feel of the place i know i m being mentally inflexible here and very ron swanson esque but honestly her living up there and me having to visit defeat the primary purpose of it after speaking with my dad he s also upset beyond word and he view this a a betrayal i do too he told me he never would have sold it to her if he thought this wa going to happen my mom is claiming i m being self absorbed and she ha every right a trustee to do whatever she want with the place and that i should be grateful for this whole thing including the compromise she s willing to make with regard to the inheriting upon my financial security she say she left that wiggle room in because she didn t think i would be financially secure enough and now she s exercising it because she want the use of the property i m not sure what to do or how to handle this if she hadn t led me and my dad to believe that this wa de facto mine and made verbal agreement to such an effect that would be one thing the big problem is i think she s doing mental gymnastics to not feel bad and not realize that this is her betraying u but my dad and i both see this a a betrayal i ve told her that from now on all agreement we make are going to have to be notarized and legally binding since she ha shown she can t be trusted with verbal agreement and she ha responded by calling me petty and that i have no empathy for family at that point i just laughed at the hypocrisy and that s where our last talk ended on sunday my wife think i m being too rigid and that compromise can be made but at this point any compromise would involve my mom going back on her word and i would still view this a a betrayal and potentially relationship destroying i m making a related post in legaladvice to see if there s anything i can legally do to stop this but at this point i don t see this a likely i guess i m trying to figure out if i m being an ungrateful son or if my sense of betrayal is valid my mom hasn t really done anything like this i want to say she s never done anything this bad but really i don t think she s ever acted in her own self interested over me before she s not a bad person which is why this whole situation struck me unexpectedly there s obviously a whole lot more to this and i could go into more detail and specific definitely matter so if any clarification are needed let me know amp x200b tl dr my parent are divorced and my dad sold some important property to my mother on the condition that it go to me my mom agreed and told me it would be mine once i can afford it i can now afford it and she ha refused to give it to me and is now going to destroy the house i grew up in to build a bigger house and retire at this property i feel betrayed and want to know if this is justified or if i m being an entitled idiot,0

i m still trapped and under his control even after having the strength to leave with our 3 month old daughter super long not sure if this is appropriate my friend recommended signing up and just typing thing out to see if it help me process everything going on i m also going to therapy but honestly nothing feel like it s enough to help me at this point i 27f wa in a relationship with my abuser 30m for two and a half year mentally emotionally physically sexually financially abused learned these term through counseling because i wa in denial for so long i didn t even think the relationship wa abusive he wa the perfect man in the beginning we were such a perfect match and had so much in common i had just ended a long term relationship called off an engagement and wasn t looking for anything serious but when i met him i felt an instant connection it took three date for a full fledged relationship to begin i had told myself learning from my previous relationship i would be open and honest with everyone about my current situation i wa still stuck in a lease with my previous fiancée but no longer had any romantic feeling for him whatsoever let s call him d i told d on our second date about being in the lease with my ex and figured he d no longer be interested but i had to be honest and he took it extremely well didn t get upset asked a couple question and moved on to new subject to discus i wa so relieved it all happened fast sex love relationship commitment his dog became ill and i had a vet tech history so he called for my help that wa technical our third date i offered to spend the night to help with her need and basically never left his house he said he loved me a few week later we became a couple and when my lease wa about to be up with my ex he asked me to move in with him instead of moving in with my mom although i had already been spending every night at his house we moved in together and thing were rough he wa very possessive and had ocd it wa hard for our thing to blend he just wanted my stuff in my office and my bathroom not combined this should ve been my first realization to leave but he convinced me it wa just because he wa so independent for so long before me no long term ex he would disclose to me he lived on his own since he got out of the military six year before air force veteran so needle to say i figured we d work through it over time so many bad thing happened i m sure i ll go into detail in other post a the flashback come to me but i even tried moving out once yet he managed to manipulate me to come back knowing exactly what to say and how to say it here i wa thinking he s finally listening to me and my need and we have a chance fast forward to me getting pregnant the one thing i waited so long to time right in my life i wa so ecstatic i wa healthy stable job what i thought wa a stable relationship in a stable home we found out she wa a girl halfway through which made it even more exciting for me and for him not so much we got engaged a couple month later everything seemed perfect again once she wa born the abuse continued only i wa seeing it for what it really wa now that i had our daughter to protect it wasn t just him having anger management issue anymore it wasn t just myself in danger anymore he came home early one day and got mad at my dog 9lbs for snipping at his dog 40lbs when she ran back into the house from outside and almost stepped on my dog no dog fight no growl no bark just a small snip from my dog to his not even any contact between the two but he flipped his usual switch and shoved my dog under the bed i got upset and reminded him he made the rule that we discipline our own dog no shouting no cussing just a reminder and an upset look on my face this wa not okay to him he shouted cussed got inch from my face and pointing his finger in my face that he ll defend his dog life no matter what i asked him several time to leave me alone get out of my face don t act like this in front of our daughter i wa breast pumping on the bed with her next to me he wa relentless so i swatted his finger hand out of my face he grabbed my wrist so hard and so fast i got instant bruise a he pinned me to the bed i kicked him off me he grabbed our daughter and left the room saying i m violent i let it go it wa just one of his mood we ll be fine but no he kept coming back i kept closing the door after him and that wasn t okay either he continued shouting cussing being aggressive in front of our daughter kept trying to make me react a per his usual i left the room and closed the door to get him away from our daughter we did our usual routine of arguing in the living room kitchen his office long story short he bear hugged restrained me wa recording me yelling back at him then stopped recording to shove his phone in my face showing me a picture of my ex from year ago and calling me all kind of name saying he ha friend that can get info for him in an instant to my wit end i unfortunately slapped him and his reaction wa to punch me in the side of the head once i fell he stepped over me and ran to the garage saying it wa my fault i made him do that being the final straw i crawled to the bedroom to be with my daughter and called 9 1 1 cop showed and basically because he recorded me yelling and cussing at him i wa the one arrested i wa labeled the aggressor and he the victim i went numb i finally reached out for help and it backfired i wa the one in trouble and now i have to be separated from my child who i had never been away from since she wa born she ha literally turned three month old that day my family bailed me out he didn t bother he did answer my call from jail to update me since his number wa local so it wa free i wa released the next day i called and asked if i could get my thing he wanted to talk we talked and he said i could be there he want to support and help me with the charge two felony count but that i wa not allowed to take his daughter anywhere not knowing my right i just became submissive i just wanted to spend a much time a possible with my daughter before the court hearing i had one night day of him being amazingly supportive the next night he talked to his brother and in one phone call everything changed he no longer trusted me i wa a manipulator i wa a liar playing a game so i could throw him under the bus at the right moment to get out of trouble for myself he kept saying he had to put his self interest first i didn t have the energy to argue i just told him fine i ll be putting our daughter best interest first from now on instead of our family unit the next morning he got worse wa attempting to kick me out threatening harm to my family and myself saying he ll call the cop and press charge so i go to prison and put a restraining order on me so l never see our daughter again my criminal defense attorney told me i wa free to leave with her he wa not allowed to threaten me it wa up to the da to press charge at this point not him i wa texting my mom everything happening a it happened she headed over my best friend headed over he called his brother to come over we all called the cop it wa a mess he had blocked in my car when i attempted to leave so we waited for the cop to get there they let me leave with our daughter we lover into my mom house to be safe a week later i reached out to him to discus final detail his relationship with our daughter and when i can get the rest of my belonging he didn t respond another week go by i call for a civil standby to get my belonging he wasn t home and his tv xboxes mountain bike and gym equipment were all gone so i got my thing and left the garage clicker and house key with the neighbor she wanted to talk to me because d went cry to her apparently told her i have post partum depression i got arrested and that i have kept him from seeing his daughter since i took off with her he s scared of my family but love me and doesn t know what to do idk why i tried but i told her my side that he s always hurt me and that i need to protect our daughter i have reached out to him twice now and no response so i am not keeping him from seeing his daughter she kept coming back to am i sure i don t have ppd can t we just work thing out so i left another week go by and he finally text me saying he want to meet in a safe public location and that he talked to the neighbor and for the clicker and key i told him i don t feel safe meeting in person it s been three week so i m nervous for our safety he s a 6 1 220lb weightlifter i am 5 3 140lb post partum mom bod i asked if we could do baby step to build up the trust back photo video facetime he never responded two day later i get served with a domestic violence restraining order and he s been granted full legal and physical custody of our baby girl want child support legal fee everything from me but i am to have zero contact with our four month old breastfeeding daughter i wa heartbroken the cop came i had to turn her over to them i tried getting her favorite toy binky all the breastmilk i had in the fridge to send with her there wa nothing i could do to stop them from taking her from me i didn t know if he had a crib for her or clothes or diaper how would she be fed they had no answer for me and just said i had to be willing to turn her over i wa terrified of going back to jail for violating a court order the court hearing wa three week away from that night friday the 13th i emptied my bank account to find an attorney m to fight for me found one we did an ex parte and now i get her three night and am basically daycare for her until the court hearing i have to do all the transportation to and from his work parking lot based on his work hour it is so hard seeing him every single day it s a mess all over again and he seems so smug he s winning he s so proud of being able to still torture me i don t know how much longer i can take this he s so clueless on how to be a parent because i did all the parenting when we were together i bathed her fed her changed her played with her so he could workout work on his jeep and play video game but now he s claiming he s scared for his life from me scared for our daughter life from me i m mentally unstable that i ve been hitting myself and blaming him and have been abusive this whole relationship that i hit him and attack him unprovoked and while he s carrying our daughter idk what to do none of it is true but how do i prove it wrong when he claim he ha video video of me attacking him when in reality those video are the second half of the fight once he s already cornered me and prevented me from leaving so i have to stand my ground with him how do i prove he s a liar when i don t have proof of his action in the one that wa arrested that night even though i wa the one that called 9 1 1 which btw the charge were declined to file i never even had to go in front of the judge ever since i left i had been going to weave the drs and therapy and counseling but his voice won t leave me alone telling me i ll lose i ll lose custody of my precious little innocent baby and also have to pay all the bill for everything even though he make double what i make i m just a mess and i feel so guilty for our daughter having to go through this i wa trying to put our issue aside and work with him on their relationship if he wanted one but he s playing the victim will the court realize this do i even have a chance at a normal life outside of him every time i think i have a chance to be free of his control something new happens any advice would be helpful if anyone ha ever been through something similar i just don t understand how the abuser can claim to be the victim how ha he not had to suffer any consequence,1

and out of jail that whole time and we really only spent about half the time together when we were on he got a kitten a few year ago from his sister and his mom took the kitten in my apt wouldnt allow animal when he went to jail for 18months he got out and got a puppy from his sister mom only because by then i had my own apartment for u that allows animal and he wa coming to live with me a in i really wa getting a puppy becuase no one trusted him with one and iw a there a a fail safe i also have my own dog so three animal two technically given to him and one of mine amp x200b like i said we broke up this summer and all the animal have consistently been with me i pay for all vet food play licensing etc we got in a couple really bad fight once in september and once right after thanksgiving both time he said he would take his animal and if i tried to stop them he would kill them in his brain they are his property and he will destroy whats his before he let anyone else take it now this is scary enough but i m fairy confident it s for show because it get him what he want me freak out and give in to what he want i told him they were registered to me they are he doesn t reliably answer his phone go off the grid go to jail whatever and i m the one who paid for it he said we were going to go down the next day after thanksgiving holiday and re register them i told him i wasnt paying for that but sure if he can come up with the money he won t he doesn t work and hasn t worked for more than a few month at a time a long a i ve known him amp x200b in his world he ha every right and ha flat out told me he can come over whenever he want a long a his pet are alive now for the lease i signed it when he wa in jail it s a six month lease which started almost 2 year ago so i m month to month now usa his name is listed at the top a a tenant but i wa the only one who signed with the landlord i don t know if technically he is not a valid tenant in a contract with the landlord but we both have always treated it a such he lost his key so he break in my bedroom window i m scared if i nail it shut he will break the glass or blow up waiting for me to let him in he ha some thing at my house but is slowly getting them out of there and then the dog cat amp x200b i have a regular office job and i sleep around 11 7am he doe not work and is on and off drug so he doesn t have a schedule he come over whenever he fee like it and i can go week without seeing him typically he come over shower eats all my food go through all my stuff sleep and then leaf after a week or two i m at the point where i m sick of it i have a hobby and he keep taking my hobby stuff and yelling at me when i ask him about it he say i m always accusing him of thing and i treat him like a bad child who is always in trouble i got 130 grocery the day before tahnksgiving and now i have nothing in my house but some peanut butter no bread popcorn canned soup pasta and cearl with no milk what i bought should have lasted me 3 week and it s all gone i asked him this weekend not to eat the last of anything and he agreed but after i asked him not to smoke inside i hate the smell he got mad and ate the rest of my cheese potato ice cream bread and snack he leaf stuff all over the floor house bathroom and leaf all the light on he s a slob i keep my house neat and tidy when he s not around there is no better feeling than knowing that everyhting will be xactly the way it wa when i get home from work a it wa when i left he never had that growing up so maybe he doens t understand what it s like to have that feeling taken away but i have never had to deal with this before i met him i have one brother and he never messed with my thing growing up amp x200b i don t know where i legally stand a he 1 ha stuff at the apartment and 2 is a listed tenant amp x200b here is what i feel my option are and why i m scared to do any of them 1 get him off the lease we made fence modification they are not permanent that we did not ask the landlord and it s kind of ugly there s also damage and my security deposit wa only 1200 i m also watching 2 other dog that belong to his friend and they have so far torn carpet eaten a door frame scratched another door eaten linoleum off the kitchen floor and dug hole in the yard i m scared the landlord going to see if he come by to sign another lesae and i cant afford to make repair right now and get another place if he evicts me or he might raise my rent which i don t want either i also need ot have a place where the dog can t get out jump and that s really hard to find where i live i m also afraid ex is going to go crazy when if i renew w o him and he ll continue to break in and lose it if i tell him not to do that amp x200b 2 move again i can t afford to move and lose my security deposit for repair at my current place i m up to my ear in credit debt and am focusing on paying that off so i don t want to waste my saving on moving i don t want to involve my landlord and have him see the damage from the friend s dog before i can maybe repair them it s super hard to find a place where i live and i love my place now again i don t want him to raise my rent and so far i have seen my landlord exactly one time almost 2 year ago to sign and i pay early every month and keep quiet so i d like to keep it that way amp x200b 3 let ex know how i feel and try to have a decent conversation hahahaha yeah right he s on drug so everything depends on his mood even if we have a sober moment to agree some groundrules he ll ignore them when he s high amp x200b 4 let ex know how i feel and fight about it i don t want to hear him threaten the pet again it s not ok but it s his trump card over me realistically he ha no where to go with them but he said he would find a friend that would take them just to keep them away from me i ll fall apart with my pet and that s not fair to them that he would do that side note he asked for a contract for the dog cat and i wrote one up and he left it on my coutner and it s been there untouched for 2 week amp x200b 5 wait it out if history repeat itself he will end up in jail soon at that point depending on how long i will probably go to my landlord and try and negotiate a renewal i can suck it up and hope for the best i mean my stuff is just that stuff but it s more that i can t even feel comfortable while i m at work knowing he could be breaking in the window at any point in time and basically be a kid in the candy store with my stuff he brought someone over to sleep it off and stuck them in my bed i can t even tell you how much effort it took me not to loose it amp x200b ahhh sorry for the long post and thank you for reading i feel like i have to plan out 6 step and tread lightly in some chess game otherwise it s just going to be a mess also i want to make it clear he ha never physically harmed me or an animal i truly believe it s just his manipulation tactic and unfortunately for me they work every time,1
just ended an unhealthy controlling 2 yr long relationship two day ago how have you guy healed your trauma to move toward healthy love my ex and i were on off for two year he wa extremely toxic and manipulative and wouldn t commit then he wanted to take me seriously and the relationship wa terrible but i stayed anyway i had absolutely no freedom he never validated my emotion and we fought all the time over stupid shit but i could never leave but i finally did and i feel amazing however i m really guarded when it come to new interest i just don t want to wind up in that situation again a well a being hyper sensitive to red flag and seeing them where there is none it s hard to become vulnerable because i had a partner who denied my feeling for so long what ha helped you guy besides therapy which i know i need to start,1
my 28 f boyfriend 27 m of a year ha been taking secret photograph of me since the start of our relationship we were at his apartment and he wa in the kitchen making food for u the moment i grabbed his laptop to find a show for u to watch on netflix i found a folder of photograph of me right there on the screen no idea why he had just left it out in the open maybe he wa looking through it before i got there and forgot to close it i don t know all i know is that i have been dating a guy who ha been following me around the city and taking secret photograph of me everywhere they go a far back a a year ago when we had started dating i genuinely have no idea how he managed to do this for a whole year without me finding out although i m clothed in the photograph and mostly just walking around the city the thought of him following me and hiding all of this is just so unbelievably creepy and inappropriate when i brought the laptop into the kitchen and asked him about what i had found he immediately froze and didn t say a word to me for a solid five or ten second only after i had said i wa going to leave did he finally say something he first apologized to me and then explained that he snapped a couple of secret photograph of me once or twice whilst i wa at a café waiting for him just because it wa a good day and he thought that i looked nice and it didn t seem like a big deal but then he kept at it for reason that he had never really understood and then he felt it wa too weird to mention to me the most recent photograph wa from a week ago i wa on my way to work and he snapped it from across the street i remember he called me that morning a i wa getting ready and had said he wa already at work which i now know wa a lie that alone is so strange and unnecessary if he liked taking photograph of me why didn t he just ask i think some small part of him like doing it in secret that is such a strange thing to hide in the first place i wouldn t have said no if he had asked to take photograph of me to keep we re in a relationship it doesn t matter what doe matter is that he hid the truth from me until i found it on my own maybe i m overreacting i don t know i left his apartment soon after having a good look through his laptop to see if there were any unclothed photograph of me or sex video or something there wa none of that he promised me that he had never taken any photograph or video of me without clothes on or anything remotely close to that although he seemed sincere in the moment i don t know what to believe anymore i told him that i need space and i just don t know how to process this it s been a couple of day not sure what to do am i overreacting why would he do this his explanation of it just sort of happening seems like a bunch of bullshit to me thing like that don t just happen maybe the first couple of time like he described but not for a whole year tl dr i m fully clothed in all of them and they re all outside on my way to work or to hang out with friend or go shopping and thing like that the fact that he ha been following me and doing all of this for an entire year and didn t think to tell me or to even ask is just so creepy to me not sure what to do am i overreacting,0

tldr need advice about how to sneakily get key back from them ramble read he ha did and a new personality ha me scared how do you leave when the person is toxic and manipulative but also completely dependent on you to the point you feel so guilty a if you re abandoning a helpless child this turned into me just typing out my thought and it ha no order and isn t well worded or organized because it s an absolute stream of thought because i haven t talked to anyone about it so i didn t stop to edit except to write this at the top because i knew if i did i wouldn t post it so this is truly a ramble i m sorry but thank you for letting me get it out i genuinely didn t think i wa in an abusive relationship but after writing this i feel like i can t deny it anymore tldr if anyone ha advice about how to get key back before breaking up with someone he s come to apartment once before without me knowing and broke an old phone of mine because he knew it had text from an ex it also ha like 5 year worth of photo so i just can t even begin the breakup process till i know i have the key cause idk what he ll do ___________________________________ dissociative identity disorder i ve met his other personality we worked through a lot of his stuff together and it worked out out of nowhere a new personality the old one ha been around since childhood abuse at 7 year old this new personality is sadistic he s only come out twice but i have a history of ptsd and last time i felt threatened to the point of dissociation my boyfriend ha significant anger issue and there were already issue with him being toxic and manipulative and having these rage attack that seem like seizure i suspect he ha traumatic brain injury from year of childhood physical abuse i m talking repeated concussion daily for year but he s never physically hurt me and he s never even really screamed at me he can be mean but it s mostly about the power dynamic because regardless of if he s doing it directly at me or in front of me i feel scared he hulk out and want to hurt himself and break thing he growl and act a if he s about to hit thing and sometimes doe but doesn t but i m so on edge and it didn t happen at the beginning of our relationship at all and then suddenly it started and it feel like the closer we get the more scared he is to lose me and that s what brings out the anger which make sense with his past trauma and it happens over normal thing like if plan change i m talking minor plan like being exhausted after work and saying let s hang tomorrow instead and i m always fucking up it feel like i don t text enough i don t see him enough he say he feel like he come second but i don t know to what because i m just an introvert who need alone time these are the way we re just kinda incompatible and all of this ha turned me into a different version of myself and i m just taking care of him constantly financially a well a mentally which would be a whole other page of writing so i ll leave it at that which would even be ok if we were friend but since it s a relationship there s the sex aspect and he feel like i don t enough and guilt me about it but when he s himself he is such a love and it hurt me so much to think about leaving partially because i do love him so much he can be an amazingly kind and supportive partner and i guess i can say i feel like this is my first real adult relationship first time i ve let myself be a vulnerable and honest and i know that s the same for him first time he s been able to be so vulnerable and honest and i hate myself for wanting to leave because he s made so much amazing progress but even a i say that i feel more like his therapist than his girlfriend and he doesn t feel like him anymore even when he s not another personality he s just very different than he used to be or maybe i see him differently because of feeling like his therapist that s genuinely the dynamic i m scared for how he ll function in life because right now i do everything for him and he s made it really clear to me that he wouldn t be okay without me and that he wasn t okay before i don t know how to deal with that and i know so much about his past and the abuse he went through and the trauma and i know how he feel like he s not worth shit i feel like if i leave i ll be reinforcing that he s not good enough because he s said to me that i make him feel good enough and he s made it really clear he want to marry me and have child and he ha this entire life long plan set up we ve been dating for a year and i feel so trapped i physically want to scream while typing this and it s not that he s not good enough we are just genuinely not romantically compatible but on top of that there s this weird abusive power dynamic and now a personality that genuinely make me fear for my safety i wish i had left when it wa just compatibility issue me and my goddamn people pleasing b but also my genuine love for him which is so confusing idk this situation is so weird i keep telling myself it s not even an abusive relationship but either way i want to end it but i feel scared to end it which should tell me that there s definitely an abusive component because it s not fear of the breakup or of being alone but fear of him or what he ll do,1
i ve 30f been hiding some thing from my husband 30m regarding his mother 47 last year he cut her off and now he s bombarded with guilt from all side it s really affecting him and what i have to say will reaffirm his decision but also break his heart we ve been through hell and realized the only way to survive that is by being 100 open and honest i feel guilty for hiding that from him but you ll see it s something you simply don t tell to people amp x200b his mother come from a rich family and ha 3 very successful sibling she on the other hand got pregnant at 15 dropped out of school and gave the custody of the kid to her oldest brother it s no secret the kid knew who her biological mother wa from a very young age but mil refuse to acknowledge that to this day she instantly got pregnant again and had my husband at 17 13 year later she had a daughter kept them both she never managed to hold on a job or a partner and her entire life is one big pity party her family support her financially and that s like a power trip to her she want them to buy her the best of everything she s completely devoid of emotion and can be incredibly cruel but they all treat her like a toddler and she act accordingly i had some issue in the past and because of that she see me a subhuman and doesn t hide her true face in front of me her behavior change the second someone else walk in the room my husband only ha a vague idea of how she treated me i only feel bad for hiding thing she said about him and her behavior when he wa sick amp x200b we met in uni and he became the best friend i ve ever had when he found out about my past baggage he didn t run away screaming but helped me heal he wanted to be with me and waited patiently until i wa ready we live in a college town local live at home until they graduate or find a good job moving out is very unusual for u he needed to escape from his home life and moved out shortly after we started dating i spent all my time in his apartment and few week later i officially moved in his mother started hating me the moment i moved in she wa convinced i planted the idea in his head she asked around and found out about my past and she never shut up about it we got engaged pretty fast and she caused a huge scene he cut all tie with her and i kept finding excuse to push the date i wa hoping they will reconcile so she can come to the wedding in hindsight i wa dumb af amp x200b 2 year later we finally had a date but a month before the wedding our life flipped upside down this will be so fucking hard to write he came down with something and being the panicked bride to be i took him to the er he went in for the sniffle the next day he wa in an induced coma turned out to be toxic shock all his organ were shutting down and he had a 3 chance of survival he wa critical for 6 day people he hadn t seen since elementary school were coming to say goodbye i never left the hospital his entire family and my parent were coming every day his mother came a grand total of 2 time she told me there s no point in her coming cause he s not awake i still can t wrap my mind around that and never told him he think she wa there all the time oh yeah she also used his illness a and excuse to quit her job and hasn t worked since 6 day later he wa awake but still pretty deep in the wood we didn t know if his kidney will regain function if his liver will react to the treatment and he had gangrene in all limb the doctor told him they might have to amputate to save his life his mother started coming every day and acting like a proper lunatic this too wa her own pity party amp x200b they amputated part of his finger first the surgery wa incredibly risky because of his overall state i wa losing my mind i didn t know if i will see him again he made it and a soon a he woke up he apologized i didn t get my perfect wedding day then he offered me a way out that wa it for me i informed him we re getting married then and there i told our family and his mother called me insane said she doesn t have time for empty gesture while her son is dying i told my parent about that and we agreed it would be best if nobody came them being there will only make him wonder why his mother isn t few day later we got married in a hospital room it wa just u the judge and 2 nurse a witness my parent didn t get to attend the wedding of their only child because of her never told him about that amp x200b few day later they amputated part of his foot it wa the best case scenario he wouldn t even need prosthetic leg while he wa in the hospital we realized we won t be able to go back in our inaccessible apartment after he s discharged we were supposed to stay with my parent during his recovery but his mother butted in again she wanted to care for her boy my parent paid for some renovation and adjustment in her guest house and we moved there his recover didn t go a smoothly a we anticipated there were further complication and surgery and we spent month there he needed constant care and i didn t trust her so my awesome bos let me work from home one day i went to the main house and saw his 9yo sister cleaning i realized she s never seen her mother clean another reminder of how stupid i am i helped her clean the house and cooked dinner his mother started asking me to help her with the cleaning and cooking i wa desperate for her to accept me so while he wa at rehab i would clean her house and cook meal for the next few day i wa working full time taking care of my husband and acting a her maid never told him that either amp x200b his finger had zero dexterity and the physical therapist suggested knitting he did a soon a he wa able to hold a needle and it s unbelievable how much it helped him his mother had something to say about that too whenever i wa over at her place she would mock him for being a granny said the next step is a sex change called u lesbian and had never ending homophobic rant she wa mocking the thing that helped him regain his independence and return to normalcy and she really took it too far ofc i never told him that either we moved out a soon a he wa back on his foot she got pissy and they didn t talk for month amp x200b some time later the bone in his foot started growing and it wa incredibly painful for him he couldn t put any weight on them the only option wa to have them amputated again this time below the knee because of his height low level amputation would only cause more issue down the line he wa scared shitless because the only prosthetic leg available in our country were world war 2 leftover there wa no way he could regain his old mobility while we were going through that stress his mother pulled the worst thing she s ever done she went to the police and said i coaxed her son into marriage while he wa drugged out of his mind and incompetent to make that decision also said he isn t back on his foot yet because i m physically abusing him a social worker came over and we cleared the situation to this day he s convinced it wa a regular check he doesn t know she called me to gloat and ask if our marriage wa annulled yet amp x200b our family jumped in to help we went to a civilized country for the amputation recovery and his new leg now he s healthy happy living a completely normal life and he s far more active and sporty than he ever used to be we re still crazy in love and that whole ordeal only brought u closer we re no longer 2 kid just out of college and we made a pretty good life for ourselves he ha an on and off relationship with his mother i haven t talked to her in year a i already said she get a rush out of people doing thing for her so having her disabled son care for her is the ultimate high every now and then he would cut her off but she would weasel back in she feigned an illness twice last year her youngest daughter got emancipated and came to live with u his mother started spiraling apparently now she ha anxiety and pesters everyone in the family to take her to different psychiatrist until someone confirms that still no diagnosis but she leech alternative treatment from her family my husband cut her off for the last time when she asked him to buy her several brand of cannabis oil to find which one suit her best and threatened to turn to actual drug if he doesn t amp x200b my baby sister in law finished high school a year early and 2 month ago she moved to another continent for uni neither of them are talking to their mother but something is going on their entire family started blaming him for cutting her off and it s starting to get to him the thing about prosthetic leg is that you don t buy them once and it s a done deal you need replacement every few year our country ha extremely low living standard and a new pair of leg is twice our combined annual salary we can not afford to take care of an almost 50yo toddler on top of that she s been unemployed for over 8 year life alone in a huge house and refuse to rent out the quest house she spends money she didn t earn like crazy and yet when he finally bought running leg she said it wa unnecessary and wasteful if i tell him everything i hid over the year he will never ever be roped into caring for her again but how could i ever tell him those thing amp x200b tldr plainly put my mil is insane refuse to acknowledge the kid she had at 15 and wa raised by her brother my husband cut tie with her at least once a year and her youngest got emancipated at 16 and moved to another continent at 17 her total work experience doesn t even accumulate to 2 year but her entire family support her insane spending habit she s always hated me and never put on that sweet helpless facade when we re alone 8 year ago my husband almost died from toxic shock and lost part of his finger and both leg while he wa in the hospital and during the recovery she said and did thing that will destroy him if he find out too many to put in a tldr but the biggest one wa reporting me to the police and getting the social service involved hoping to get our marriage annulled last year he cut her off again and now his entire family is trying to guilt him into reinstating their relationship which will eventually turn to taking care of her financially we can not afford that cause we live in a backwards country and every few year he ha to travel abroad to get new prosthetic leg and pay them in full i see that all the pressure is starting to affect him and at time i just want to scream it all out if he knew those thing he wouldn t think twice about his decision to cut her off but i could never hurt him like that i d rather use the her or me card i m genuinely losing my mind,0

bf 18m trying time control me 17f with my new phone my bf is a pretty dominant person it s not bad i like it sometimes i guess we have been together for a year and a half he s honestly an awesome guy but we have been having a lot of problem lately involving his family and our friend but this is about our phone lol i bought an iphone 6 plus for 400 dollar off kijiji at the end of 2017 it wa all my hard earned money i worked long shift to be able to afford it cause i had a pretty shitty phone before iphone 5c that had screen cracked and just many malfunction it felt awesome buying a new phone because no one could control it my parent nor anyone else could have a say because i worked for that phone and it didn t fall under anyone else s name only mine so anyways my bf ha always been kinda controlling with my phone always demanding password and he deleted every guy of my snapchat which honestly i didn t care cause i didn t talk to them anyways and i knew he wa just insecure but there were a few time we would argue or fight and he would throw my phone or say something about it i really liked that phone it had great quality compared to my older one so three day ago we were arguing and i interrupted his sentence one thing led to another and he wa reaching for my phone and i said no i knew he wa too angry at the moment and he would probably snap it in half a he had actually bent and broke a part of the screen the week before i know it wasn t an impulsive decision he wa literally saying hand me the phone i m going to break it while i m telling him no i need my phone i have a job i cannot contact my bos without my phone or get my schedule yadda yadda you know we pulled and tugged for my phone for about two three minute before i finally just let go and he stepped out of the car and smashed it i wa pretty emotionless towards it cause i wa like okay well what the fuck hahah cause like what do you even do in that situation i said why would you destroy my property he said i didn t deserve a phone and i shouldn t have one the next day he felt horrible and i explained all that stuff i just explained in that second paragraph he said okay i will buy you a new phone the reason i broke it is cause you re birthday next week and i am planning on buying you the newest phone i said okay kinda suspicious cause he did it out of anger it didn t seem like he wanted to be nice at the time but i wa obviously happy because my phone wa getting outdated and starting to die at 20 percent so ya i wa happy we agreed i would get the iphone xr and he would pay until the 400 dollar wa up and then i would take over which i wa perfectly fine with because i wanted a new phone he got it under his name and we were gonna switch it to under my name on my birthday in a week cause you have to be 18 so i take it home it s awesome i m typing on it right now i really like it but the very day i got it he had already threatened to take it back after i said it s confusing to manage because it doesn t have a home button i wasn t complaining i had already told him many time i wa grateful and really liked it but after that i wa just like okay i m sorry then the next day yesterday we got into a fight completely irrelevant to the phone he immediately took my phone and i said please give it back he said no this is my phone it s under my name and you don t deserve it i m returning it and getting myself a phone i said i thought it wa a birthday gift but okay then please give me the 400 i spent on the phone you broke so i can figure out what to do about not having a phone he said no that phone isn t worth 400 it s worth probably only 100 and you don t need a phone anyways i literally wa like bruh how do you not understand you broke my phone i just lost the 400 you fucking broke so give me the money cause i am literally phoneless i dont want to be manipulated and threatened every day just cause it under your name he didn t care lol anyways he apologized and said sorry but i m just thinking is it really worth keeping this phone or should i just get the 400 if he even give it to me i m at a loss of what to do what would you guy do remember i do love him and he s not usually like this tl dr bf broke my phone and is now using the new phone he bought me to manipulate me into doing what he want,0

when i 18m turned 18 about 3 month ago my parent f46 m51 informed me i will have to pay rent so i did however now i am moving out next week and didn t tell them until yesterday a such they are angry i need advice the title honestly is a short version of what is happening so a little over 3 month ago i turned 18 the day after my father and my mother informed me i would be required to pay rent and that my rent would be 350 euro s now i happen to know that the total cost of renting the house my parent rent is roughly 700 750 euro s a such they were basically asking me an 18 year old with a part time job to cover half the rent despite my lazy brother 19m not paying a cent towards rent also let me add to this that having your child pay rent is considered to be extremely weird in my country it basically happens to no one unless their parent are in extreme financial hardship which definitely is not the case here my parent are not rich by any mean but my dad make plenty to live comfortably and our rent is considered extremely low even by local standard atop this my wage for the month are around 800 euro s on a good month but usually more or le around 600 euro s generally i tried to get more hour but my job would not let me a i am only a part time employee now of course i wa angry about this but just decided to pay it a i did not want to get kicked out or something but in the meantime planned for college getting a college loan getting a college apartment and getting a new part time job where i wa going to study to make a long story short it all worked out i wa allowed to join the college course i wa joining late in the year and i informed my bos a month ago and he wa sad to see me go but wished me good luck and i wa allowed to finish the last month now yesterday my dad demanded my rent for this month so i gave him a little over half the money around 250 euro s and informed him i would be moving out by the start of the next week this turned in to a huge fight where they were yelling at me because they did not want me to move out a i am apparently not old enough i am legally an adult and they had already planned my 350 euro s in to their finance for the next several month now what do they use my money for you ask going out to dinner going to see movie buying luxury good literally nothing towards paying the actual rent a my parent can easily cover it so i told them about this and i added that they were really dumb for expecting me to pay them rent and then continue to treat me a if i am their teenage son literally i still have fucking curfew and shit in place and i told them they were not charging my brother rent so i felt slighted to begin with well they told me to grab my shit and get out so that is pretty much what i did after demanding they give me 75 euro s back which wa meant to cover my last week at home at this point i am staying at a good friend of mine who have graciously allowed me to stay the week and store my stuff until i move to my student apartment next week now here is the thing i sort of need advice a to how to deal with my parent a i do not want to lose them and their behavior these last 3 month is not representative of the last 18 year on the other hand i want them to treat me a an adult and apologize for their idiotic behavior towards me so what to do reddit tl dr i wa suddenly required to pay rent despite my brother not having to pay anything i did so for about 3 month before putting my plan of moving out in to action and now my parent are angry and we are not talking advice,0

update apparently i f31 married a narcissist m35 original post my f31 husband m34 of 5 year take me for granted thank you to everyone for your comment on my original month ago i actually wa quite surprised by the resounding gong of how terrible he is and needed a lot of time to digest the response my first reaction wa that i exaggerated or only put one side into the story and that he isn t really that bad the switch flipped for me after a few series of event in the last 2 month first i wanted to sign up our oldest child up for a weeknight evening activity and my husband wa not fond of the idea but when i kept pushing he said if i did signup it wa all on me and that i wa not allowed to get frazzled or stressed out on the day of the activity i realized he doesn t want to signup because he doesn t want to change his quality of life shortly after that he wa travelling for work and i wa lying in bed alone and i realized i hadn t gotten my period in a while open my app to check when it due i m on day 52 of my cycle and we had sex immediately before my fertility window i cannot be pregnant i panicked and i didn t even want to tell him i feared telling him i still haven t told him 2 month later i thankfully just skipped a cycle i started fantasizing what it would look like to split time with our kid casually looking for work to see what is out there if when we break up and totally talking about it with my girlfriend then one lunch in front of the kid out of nowhere we had a colossal fight for u surprisingly and quite out of character i wa totally calm and when he would go at me with is this what the next 35 year of our life will be like i would just say i hope not and when he said something about divorce i just said that doesn t scare me i wa solidly expecting to be fighting all christmas because i really thought the best thing would be to separate and he now knew that wa something i wa considering a couple hour later he wa super sweet telling me he ll never stop fighting for u and that i am the best at everything i do which is true and that he just wanted u to be better that he would be better in the couple day that followed he said a couple of thing to our kid that make me cringe i m sure some people parent with shame intentionally but i am not okay with it and i immediately called him on it and told him that wa one of the thing i did not like he seems to have taken note and ha not done it since he is taking an interest in an entrepreneurial project of mine which is a complete 180 from before it is just an interest when i want to talk about a new idea or spin on something related to my project he is mostly dismissive but will tolerate me talking about it our 6th anniversary came and went over the holiday break he remembered a couple day before but did not plan anything the day of wa forgettable he did however buy me grocery store flower and write a nice note in a card i still feel skeptical i m hesitant and i don t know if this is genuine we are attending a work conference in a month for his company and i am concerned that his change in attitude is to keep me in line so we present well and i don t embarrass him i feel like he is trying to check the box that he think will make me happy without actually put in real effort i also feel like he is trying and i should give him a chance i don t know what to do tldr an update to an old comment made me think that i had exaggerated until a series of thing triggered me to plan to leave a 90 of comment told me to when i told him i wasn t scared of divorce and that it had crossed my mind he freaked out and in 2 hour came back to me that he wa going to fight for u and that we can be better he ha been better but i can t seem to shake my hesitation,0

we ve entire family i m 34 started to get creepy letter from my brother 31 i don t know what to do with them i m working on rebuilding a relationship with my parent my parent are working on rebuilding their relationship with my husband and me they realize that my brother kind of scapegoated u and tried to drive a wedge so hey progress i ve written about this before but here s some back story my brother burned down my parent house and ha been accepted into a program that would enable him to skip prison time for his crime provided he follows this special court s rule so he s in therapy etc it s a structured program that seems to rely on participant having root in the community which he doe not have because my parent moved away and i do not live in the area either nobody seems to be able to get him housing via the program and my parent and i have been unsuccessful in finding him a place to live super hard to find housing for arsonist so he may end up living in a homeless shelter until he get a job and figure the housing element out for himself this is i suppose a separate issue he is absolutely sane competent per the court according to his evaluation he ha depression adhd and ptsd though we don t understand the ptsd diagnosis at all because it seems his issue is actually a lack of empathy of any kind he ha not apologized for what he did in any way claiming it wa a suicide attempt though he trashed the house before he set it on fire and he fled the scene immediately afterwards with no injury to himself in the meantime he s started sending our family letter that feel kind of like a manifesto he doesn t have any resource so i don t think he could hurt people in any significant way but i am alarmed to read them two have come so far he doesn t threaten violence in any of them it s more like he is telling u his world view and it is somewhat terrifying i don t have any contact with the court or with his people in any way he ha not signed a release so they won t even acknowledge he s in this program i m worried they re being had he is exceptionally smart though he may not even manipulate them on purpose i don t know who to contact or what to do if anything the letter come to my parent new apartment but are addressed to the family my dad scan them and sends them to my other brother my husband and me we have all agreed they are creepy but what if anything do we do with them do i communicate with my brother in hope he will come around somehow cut him loose stop reading the letter tell someone about the letter yes everyone is in therapy over this tl dr my brother sends u creepy letter that feel like a manifesto he ha no access to any weapon who do we tell if anyone,0
i m 25 m at a complete loss with the reason my ex 24 f left me for well this break up wa a while back about 8 month ago i m not really looking for advice on how to get her back more or le i want to if anyone ha been on the other side and can explain so we were together 4 year she is drop dead gorgeous her beautiful vibrant blue eye her amazing wavy blonde hair her cute red nose that i always called her who person nose her perfectly proportioned body she is a very kind shy mousey person with the sweetest heart love animal and other human just a very caring person in general i am or at least wa in love with her so badly she made me feel so warm and comfortable inside she wa so affectionate and attentive towards me we definitely were not a perfect relationship because i believe no relationship can be perfect but i d say 95 of the day were good day with her she had some trust issue that she carried into our relationship from her last i have a hard time expressing myself and sometimes that led to confusion or conflict and we disagreed politically but we learned to live with our opposing view later on okay so now onto the problem her father passed away about 2 5 year ago it wa a very hard time for her she spent a lot of time off of work even month after she wouldn t talk to anyone for quite a long time afterwards and she wa a hermit during that time understandably of course well naturally i wanted to comfort her so i started waking up early and making her breakfast i gave her massage daily and i d always try to come up with a new compliment to give her each day i didnt quite plan on this becoming a normal daily thing but just to do while she wa grieving so that she could grieve without having to worry about getting up to make food first thing in the morning so that she could feel like her body wa relaxed while there s a lot going on emotionally and so that she knew i wa here i love her very much and i care about her and no matter how many tear rand down her face she will always be beautiful in my eye however i ended up like cooking for her in the morning and i ended up like giving her a massage and i liked complimenting her so i kept doing it i did this and more until the day she left well on that day it started like any normal weekend i woke up a bit later i hopped in the shower i played some video game checked the mail well she wa in bed a bit later so i went to check on her to make sure she knew that it wa about to hit 12pm but she wa awake and softly cry at first i thought maybe she wa thinking about her dad so i asked her if she wanted to go visit the place we spread his ash she replied with no which would mean that s not what she wa sad about because any time she wa thinking about him she would want to visit this place so i asked her what s up and she dropped a bomb on me it wasn t screaming and yelling or anything and nothing out of anger but she expressed to me how she couldn t be with me anymore because i m too kind i wa entirely taken back by this comment but asked her to elaborate all she said wa i cant explain it but you re too kind and i feel like i cant be with you anymore i asked her if there s anything i could change i repeatedly asked if i had done something wrong or if this wa a more deep rooted issue she said no to everything and she said she wa sorry but that she couldn t be with me we both cried we both talked a lot about our time spent together but she wa dead set on me being too kind and it wa her ultimate decision to leave and move in with her mother im very torn on this i wa very heart broken and i m still left with no answer she ha contacted me from time to time asking me how i am doing i tried talking to her the first two time about why she left and asking if she wanted to come back and nope still no explanation aside from the short answer that i m too kind and she doesn t really know why she feel the way she feel but know she cant be with me i asked if she felt that i wa too soft or a push over or if she wanted a bad boy but she say no to that too she told me she still love me deeply and care about me the last time wa about 3 week ago and i finally asked her to stop contacting me because it hurt too much i mean whatever i guess i m getting over it and i m trying to get back onto the market and move on but i m still very confused about everything and i feel like i need to know a more expansive answer so my question is ha any one of you experience i guess either side of this do any of you feel like there s something more to this i certainly do anyhow i m gonna hit the sack for the night any feedback would be amazing thanks tl dr gf left me because i m too sweet kind i have no explanation beyond this am seeking for any feedback or potential answer,0

my 30 f nephew 14 m wa made aware of the fact that he is my biological son i had him when i wa really young and not in the right stage of life to be raising a child particularly without his biological father for that reason my brother 40 m and sil 40 f adopted him and raised him a their own we agreed to keep the adoption hidden until he wa ready to process the information at the time i thought that wa best because the adult in my life had said a much and because i truly just wanted to move on from the abusive relationship that i found myself in at so young an age but over the year i ve done some reading and it seems it s actually better to be honest with the child from a young age so that the adoption isn t such a shock and to really just open those line of communication early on in any case it wasn t really my choice i wa ready to go along with whatever my brother and sil wanted and they wanted to raise him thinking he wa their biological son once the adoption went through i finished high school a year early and moved to the other side of the country for uni and to really just start over somewhere new since then thing have only changed for the better i have my own career going and a solid group of friend that i consider family at this point once or twice a year i do go back to my hometown to visit my actual family but i haven t for the past couple of year in part it s just uncomfortable for me being there because i feel out of place now but also my sil ha kind of always had it out for me my mum think it s because my sil is resentful of the fact that she couldn t have her own biological child sil is from a very traditional upbringing so i guess that sort of thing matter to her more than it doe other people that s fair enough but still doesn t explain why she ha always been so rude and standoffish toward me recently my nephew scored a game winning goal for his hockey team a short clip of which my sil had posted to social medium i liked the post and left a quick comment in support within that same day sil blocked me and i m still confused a to why honestly i would probably try to have more of a presence in my nephew s life if my sil weren t so weird about u interacting doe she think if we hang out long enough that he will magically sense i gave birth to him and ask to come live with me instead that is not how it work and i would never tell him the truth a it s not my place they are his parent they are the one who have raised him for fourteen year been there for every birthday dentist appointment hockey game etc i am just that distant aunt that he see at christmas i respect them a his parent and i always have that is why it make not one shred of sense to me that my sil would have told her son the truth in the way that she did apparently my nephew went to a friend s house after school one day and stayed out too late didn t answer his phone etc he had been acting out too much for my sil s liking and so when he finally come home they got into an argument whilst my brother wa still at work and she ended up saying something along the line of if you were really my son you wouldn t be like this my nephew wa confused by that and so he persisted until she explained the truth to him not only that he wa adopted but that he happens to my biological son and that his biological father wa a slightly older guy who had taken advantage of me when i wa still very young part of the reason my brother had wanted to keep the truth from my nephew wa due to the circumstance of the adoption he didn t want his son to know that he wa the result of such a shitty situation my sil decided otherwise without telling any of the other people involved and now my nephew know the truth he wa the one who called me and asked if it wa true i wa completely caught off guard and didn t know what to say it wa the middle of the night and i could tell he had been cry i told him that it wa true because i wasn t about to lie to him more than i already had and now his parent are considering getting a divorce the whole situation is out of control and i m not really sure what i can do to help my nephew ha expressed the fact that he would like to get to know me and honestly speaking i would like that a well but i just don t know really know how to go about it i spoke to my therapist about everything and she said to just go into it a though i m getting to know my biological nephew forget the history it can wait i m going home for christmas in a couple of week i ll see everyone then how do i navigate the situation tl dr sil who ha always been resentful towards me told nephew the truth during an argument with him now that he know the truth i m not sure how to navigate seeing everyone at christmas especially him how do i go about this in a way that s best for him,0

my boyfriend fucked up in a major life way but i can t help but feel bad for him this might be a little long because i want to make sure i give you guy all the necessary background but thank you for the help my 25f boyfriend 30m have been together for four year when he wa 23 or 22 he got a duo i know really bad but i never judged him for it i didn t even know him at the time and i haven t really pressed the matter and ask for a lot of detail because it seemed like he had it handled i think about a year or two after his duo he got into a motorcycle crash he wasn t driving and got seriously injured without going into to much detail he spent month and month in recovery and now he ha some pretty serious physical limitation and therefore had to quit his job that he loved and got paid well at and due to this he felt like it wa easier to move back home so his parent could help him with recovery and build his life back together then i met him right a he started working again and getting his life in order in some way i feel like he ha gotten too comfortable living at home his parent don t push him to do anything and basically do everything for him i also understand that he is very limited on the job he can have because of his accident with no degree and in such a small town i have talked to him more then a few time about trying to get a better paying job and move out together but i try not to push it too hard because i do see him making small change i can t imagine what he s gone through and i don t want to be insensitive he explained to me when we got together that because of his accident he wa just going to wait to get his license because i guess after a certain amount of year a lot of the court fee drop off at least that s what i understood from it that time wa up last october 2018 and he been dragging his foot on getting it he s been dealing with depression and anxiety and i m sure ptsd over what happened i wanna help him and make it better because i love him dearly but i don t think he s been even willing to help himself i ve offered to help him do whatever he need to start picking his life up again and i ve always been there for him long story short he got pulled over using his suspended and didn t go to jail that night but his lawyer said he d probably spend like 6 12 month in jail he told me he didn t think it wa fair to stay together because he would just be holding me back and he called himself a loser for still living at home and having a mediocre job now honestly i can t say i disagree with him i ve given up dream job opportunity to stay near him he s never really been supportive about my career he doesn t like that i travel so much but i love it i m the only one saving money and i feel like i m the only one with ambition he ha totally given up he doesn t see any hope at the end of the tunnel because now he ll have to go to jail and he ll probably never get a license he feel like his life is over which i do agree i think it s going to be a lot harder now so here s the thing i feel horrible for even thinking that i might want to break up with him especially because what ha caused all this is his lack of planning and motivation something we have had several talk about i feel like i should be there through thick and thin and work through this with him but he s also my best friend and can t imagine a life without him i m so torn i guess i just really wanted some unbiased opinion what should i do tldr boyfriend is possibly going to jail for a year due to his lack of motivation and ambition to want to change his life for the better we were already having slight problem before this and i am not sure if i should stick with him through thick and thin or leave,0

a draft i add to everytime i feel overwhelming angry hey i just want to say what you did to me so you don t hurt anyone else you trapped me in an emotionally abusive relationship and that s not an exaggeration having someone s location bank pin password is not normal habitually checking someone s phone message email finance camera roll is not normal telling someone you are going to kill yourself or would kill yourself if they leave is major emotional abuse treating someone like a child and forbidding them to do thing is emotional abuse dumping all your emotional baggage onto someone make them feel numb using self deprecating behaviour to indicate that someone s done something wrong in your eye is emotional abuse getting something and then making someone else pay for it is shitty assuming someone else s action on previous people is insane pretending you re into someone s kink and then shaming them for it is a dick move emotionally blackmailing people to do thing is wrong making someone feel bad about what they are wearing is horrible ignoring what someone say is horrible continuing to try and get to someone though family member is not right fighting with someone physically and actually causing pain is not a normal relationship trait using kink a an excuse to hit someone because you re angry at them is not okay making fun of someone s body hair is horrible ignoring someone s sexuality is homophobia being depressed isn t a personality trait pushing someone to be medicated is wrong ignoring someone who s in the same room a you is mentally damaging trying to connect to someone s family so they don t break up with you is wrong,1

husband 33m and i 31f moved our family 2f and 4f around the world for my job husband hate it and want to go home i don t think i can support him to do that this might be long for background we have been together 10 year and have 2 kid we are australian and have lived there our whole life until the start of this year when i got a job in france the pay is very low and we struggle to make end meet otherwise the oldest child and i have settled in alright i go to work she go to school husband and the youngest child have not settled in and mostly stay home in our very small apartment all day husband is depressed and want to move back to australia while i want to whatever i can to support him to be happy i think his plan to go back is deeply flawed and that he hasn t given france enough of a chance he is definitely depressed our new life in france my job is great experience for me and a good step forward in my career but a combination of complicated french bureaucracy tax cultural difference my lack of french and probably plain old stupidity from me and my employer meant that i didn t realise until much too late how low my take home pay would be i am a postdoc here so i have a phd and am working towards a career in academia but grad student and postdoc are notoriously underpaid and overworked the kid are in french public school the idea being that they re little and immersed and will pick up french fairly quickly kid can start in french school a young a 2 year old a long a they re toilet trained our youngest is enrolled at school but hasn t actually been yet because she isn t toilet trained yet and likely won t be for at least a few more month we also couldn t get her into childcare because a rude french lady wouldn t let u apply because we don t speak french and we can t afford a nanny so she s at home with husband all day every day before we realised just how dire our financial situation would be here husband wa happy to be a sahd then we realised we would have to get the kid into care right away and get him into work to live comfortably but we know how limited we are since we don t speak french he want to work in ngo but ha only managed volunteering position in the past and his last paid work wa 3 year ago in childcare so he s been looking for remote work but there is really nothing and he will struggle to get a regular job until the youngest is in some other care husband s depression husband is a very positive patient kind and empathetic person so in general if he is not feeling good about something you know it s serious his general mood and outlook have gone seriously downhill in the last 6 month to the point he is hating everything about france and ha decided the solution is to leave he want to get out asap move home get set up in an apartment find childcare and a job there are no real specific to this plan and he is resistant to hearing about my reservation how are you going to pay rent what if you don t find a job i still have 2 year on my contract what am i supposed to do at first i wa so worried about him being depressed i wanted to do whatever i could to support him and if that meant letting him go then ok so i proposed he look for job and if he get one he can go he said no he ha to be in australia while he is looking so i said ok maybe he can stay with his mum for a few week month while he look or even just stay with her and recharge for a while he say no he need to be doing something with himself and he need to be in his own space he need an apartment what about the kid he want to take them too because they d have a better life in australia i managed to talk him down to just taking the youngest leaving right away a the oldest is nicely settled and can wait until he ha something more solidified in place i m not really ok with the youngest being so disrupted and going into that kind of uncertainty but if he left both with me i can t go to work anymore i don t want to split the kid up though so if they can t stay with me maybe they have to go with him the very idea of him leaving with the kid is heartbreaking to me i have brought up seeing a doctor but we don t speak french or know the system very well so it seems like a very big task to even find someone to talk to husband opportunity in france the only job in france for people who speak english and not french are babysitting tutoring or working in british themed pub all of which my husband ha experience in however he doesn t want to even try to get those job because he say he doesn t have time being full time caregiver for our youngest kid they re not in his chosen field so he d be moving backwards and he already hate france so why would he prolong the misery by working here when he could go back instead i said he can work after 5pm and i will look after the kid or i can even take a day off every week so he can work or the weekend but he s not having it he ha always had trouble accepting help from me and he ha a habit of immediately disliking idea that weren t his my job provides french lesson for me and husband but he doesn t want to go because he ha no time he hate any kind of lesson anyway he ha duolingo but he s too miserable to use it a for sitting around the house all day i have looked into resource around u the local library playground and park are few and far between in france but they re around signing up for toddler gymnastics or swimming lesson the local community garden but he say it s all going to be in french anyway and it s so hard to go anywhere with a squirmy toddler especially coming home we live on the fourth floor with no elevator and we have no money to afford anything i know our parent would be happy to chip in for something like gymnastics but he think it s a big waste to give u money to keep him somewhere he hate my reservation so first of all i don t seem to appear anywhere in husband s very vague plan he assumes i will come back to australia to join them a soon a i can but career wise i will be shooting myself in the foot to cut my contract short here and there is no guarantee that i can pick up work in australia otherwise we wouldn t have had to leave in the first place it s not just that we ve worked hard for me to get where i am and it would be a shame to throw it all away but i am the only income and have been for several year my potential income is quite high and i should be on my way there in the next few year if all go well now husband ha been looking for work in his field for year and ha only landed unpaid internship and volunteer position this is an unfortunate reality in his field and i m worried that the longer this go on the harder it will get he worked in childcare year ago and wa very good at it and enjoyed it i encouraged him to continue with that kind of thing but he just think that he will end up stuck in that kind of work wasting time that he could be getting better for his chosen field he doesn t see some of the overlap connection and opportunity between the two that i see and i don t like to argue because he should know better than i do being in france is an opportunity for the kid i want to maximise if he just hold on a few more month the youngest kid can go to school and it will be such an amazing experience for her i also don t want to uproot the kid any more than absolutely necessary he doesn t like the school because it is physically small and doesn t have any real outdoor space also i don t want to flatter myself but i imagine husband might be sad without me i think his plan is totally unrealistic i don t want to tell him i don t believe in him but realistically he won t get a job and definitely not right away he will be facing a whole different set of challenge and i think he ll find himself at least a miserable in australia a he is here neither of u know what to do husband say he love me and the last thing he want is to be apart from me which obviously doesn t sit right with me logically if you love me so much why are you straining to get away from me he say it s not me it s france but my self worth is pretty low now anyway i ve tried to gently ask about his solution to some of the hole in his plan and tried to compromise everywhere i can to the point where i m just sabotaging and hurting myself so he can do this but he s really not listening to reason and is not budging much on his plan i am thinking more and more that him leaving would be a terrible mistake that it would be bad for him completely break me leave u both unemployed uproot the kid and

i cheated on my abuser while in another country and i don t regret it at all i know this probably won t go over well with many of you and i can t accept that i m using a throwaway because my abuser us reddit and he doesn t know this happened despite u now being broken up i went to another country for a few week a part of my major s program and i fell in love with someone else so i cheated i wanted to break up with my abuser for so long we lived together had been together for year and i wa afraid of leaving him i wa afraid of being on my own and of jeopardizing my housing we live in a very expensive area that i could not afford to live in on my own meeting the person that i did when i wa abroad changed my life he treat me with dignity respect and most importantly a warmth i didn t know existed in another person my abuser wa emotionally abusive he would go into fit of rage and call me terrible name throw thing break thing and on a few occasion would strike me he would do this in public sometimes it wa humiliating so when i went away and met someone who treated me like i wa meant to be treated i cheated i had no love left for my abuser i desperately wanted out i don t regret it i don t think i did anything wrong if i m being honest why should i show respect for someone who so clearly never did the same for me why should i be loyal to someone who doesn t deserve it he will never know he doesn t need to know i am so much happier now if i hadn t cheated i would have come home back to my abuser and would probably be stuck in the same situation if not worse that i wa when i left cheating changed my life for the better,1
my wife 38f confessed she cheated on me 38m with one of my closest friend 43m i feel lost tl dr working hard to save our marriage then wife fuck my best friend and bond emotionally with him wife and i have been married for 13 year have two daughter 10 and 7 and have been together for 19 year like many old couple our marriage wa slowly going adrift but i though we were still a strong couple with good communication we had been to a couple conselor to address our issue after her confession i feel like i have been betrayed twice it all started under my roof during my birthday party when they apparently hid to kiss then they dated for the last month in the meantime i spent quality time with my wife and this exact same friend held big holiday party with them you might want to know that i do not live in my native country so my circle of friend is like my chosen family i am so pissed i can t help but thinking i am responsible for that by neglecting my wife i am an hyperactive workoholic university professor i also co own a small company and sometimes take contract a an actor model wife and i counselor had agreed that we should spend more time together a a couple recently please don t judge u my wife also suggested that we try opening ourselves to other stuff like fucking a stranger to spice up our almost dead couple and wake up our inner pulsions i agreed never would i have thought she would be open to something like that being jealous a hell when i am not home but now i understand that she wa already seeing the guy and that he might not be just a fuck friend because she is probably involved emotionally with him from what i understood but at the same time she confessed me all because she feel lost so guy and gal help me out should i give up on her them this guy is figuratively dead to me should i forgive and go forward to save my family and pretend that it is just one of the extra adventure that we allowed ourselves to have should i just wait and see,0
i 20m have just learned half of my friend group don t actually like me how do i leave these friend without starting drama between them and the friend in the group who do like me okay i need to give a bit of background to make this more clear i m a second year college student and i ve had this group of friend since about this time last year i didn t force my way in or anything i got invited to join by someone in the group this is a fairly large friend group but the most relevant people to our story are c 19f k 19f and h 19m who were all in the group and i hung out with regularly then there s e 19m and b 19m who were apart of the group but we didn t hang out often until his year due to schedule and other factor so i pretty much have had these friend for a while and thing were good i got invited to hang out with them all the time and we had ton of fun together and our personality really clicked or at least i thought that then this year thing changed i wa only ever invited to thing by k who is one of my best friend the rest of them only really ever hung out with me when i wa with k and i started to suspect that they didn t enjoy having me around and just let me hang with them because k and i were close and she wanted me around i contemplated this and kind of split from the group for a few day to figure some thing out i chalked it up to my paranoia since i have a fear of being alone i figured i wa just projecting my fear and making it just seem like no one liked me k hit me up after all this to say that everyone wa wondering where i wa so i also felt like this wa a sign that they cared thing went smooth for a while until last night i wa hanging out with b and e most of the day and i heard about their plan to hang out later that night in e s dorm note they didn t tell me i heard them talking about it to k that morning i wasn t eavesdropping i wa sitting at the table with them and they made no effort to hide the plan so i assumed they were cool with me coming fast forward to later when it s just b and myself we re heading back to the dorm and he asks me what i plan on doing i tell him i have nothing better to do so i figured i d go hang with them in e s dorm b say that they never hammered out the detail so he doesn t know when they re hanging out and it s still early note that is not entirely true they planned to start at 10 from what i heard but i wa only like 9 at the time and he either could ve forgot the time or they started changing the time when i wasn t listening so i didn t think much of it we part way and i hang out in my dorm for awhile waiting for one of them to hit me up and tell me it s time note again this party only consisted of b e h and c k and the others had plan at 9 40 i hear music blasting from e s dorm which is right next to mine i figured they must have just forgot to let me know so i go over to e s dorm and start knocking the room go from people yelling and music playing to just music playing now i have to preface this again i wa not eavesdropping or putting my ear on the door i heard everything loud and clear from the hallway this is what i heard after one of them looked through the peephole h how did he know about the party e he wa with u all day of course he know they don t open the door or anything i just kind of stand there in shock i had a weird gut feeling i wasn t their favorite person in the group but i didn t realized they disliked me to this degree so i m hurt and confused so i just stand there for a minute or two trying to figure out what to do then this happens e he s still outside c that s so funny so after that i go to one of my friend outside this group to vent about my frustration how i feel like the 11 year old brother tagging along with the cool teenager because mom said so but none of the teen actually want around how i feel like i ve tried so hard to be a good friend and someone fun to be around how i feel like i tried to be a considerate and helpful friend how i feel like the past year ha been a lie before everyone tell me to cut them off for being fake friend i know that already i m going to do just that my real problem is how this is going to effect everyone else in the group the last thing i want to do is create drama that would split the group because my real friend and fake friend and still super close to each other right now and i d hate to ruin that hey may have treated me poorly but he group of fake are still good people i just think they tried to spare my feeling with dishonesty without realizing that the lie would hurt more than anything else i assume this because they did it to another person before they left the friend group i know i know red flag wa in fact red tl dr i found out about my fake friend and want to leave them behind without causing infighting and drama between them and my real friend,0

i 32f am worried that my boyfriend 35m ha an inappropriate relationship with my son 12m just over 2 year ago now my son s father dan abandoned our family and moved to the other side of the country obviously my son chris and i were both devastated dan had been the breadwinner i got pregnant with chris when dan and i were still in college and we got married soon after although dan and i had separated briefly in the past i didn t have any real reason to believe our marriage wa anything le than perfect even dan s mother is disgusted by what he did and she help support me and chris she life nearby dan himself seems to have no interest in seeing his son again i have no idea what prompted this change in him i still sometimes just break down cry over it even now i still look back and try to think of what the warning sign were chris recovered from the loss of his dad better than i did he looked up to his dad in a lot of way but dan traveled a lot for work and didn t get a much quality time in with chris a i would have liked anyway about a year ago one of my friend from high school mark moved to my hometown one thing led to another and mark and i started dating now we are very serious about our future together and even considering marriage mark ha honestly been a godsend he ha stepped up to the plate in so many way he ha become like a father to chris and chris absolutely adores him but thing have gotten out of hand in my opinion chris started behaving very strangely around 4 month after mark and i started dating since them he imitates almost everything that mark doe if mark us a certain type of cologne chris ha to have that type of cologne he want his hair cut the same way mark doe he even wanted to dye his hair blonde to match mark s when i nixed that idea he threw a fit and even though chris ha always hated wrestling he decided to join his school s wrestling team because he know mark wrestled in college in a way it might be a good thing because he needed the exercise and mark is able to give him pointer but i worry that it s part of a pattern of obsession also my son s teacher told me that he ha been signing his last name a mark s rather than my ex husband s not to mention mark seems be encouraging it at first i wa glad that chris had a positive male role model so i wa happy if mark picked chris up from practice or hung out with him especially because i m working over night at the hospital a lot but it s honestly gotten to the point that i think mark spends more time with chris than i do it doesn t help that mark inherited a small fortune his house is frankly a lot more fun to spend time in than our tiny apartment he s got a pool a basketball court an arcade etc of course we ve discussed chris and i moving in many time but given my concern i thought it would be best to wait the worst part is it seems to be intensifying a few day ago chris and i were spending the night at mark s and i got called away to work in the middle of the night when i came back i found chris sleeping next to mark worse mark wa naked he typically sleep naked when i shouted to wake them up they both acted like i wa overreacting i told chris it wa inappropriate for him to be sleeping like that with someone who wasn t his dad and he said mark is my dad i didn t know to respond i later asked him if he and mark had slept together before and chris said that they do it all the time i wa so pissed off that i went to mark s house to break up with him when i got there he just treated me like i wa making a big deal out of nothing i sometimes i think i m going crazy for worrying about this my friend all like mark my ex husband s mother also adores him and think chris is just catching up on missed male bonding time everyone tell me that i m just afraid of something good happening to me chris doe seem happier than he s ever been his grade are way up and he s taking better care of himself i do have a tendency to over think thing and to be overly skeptical am i the crazy one here what should i do tl dr my 12 year old son is spending a huge amount of time with my boyfriend i m worried that it s too much and that it s inappropriate especially because they ve been sleeping in the same bed,0

is this gaslighting my current boyfriend ha been wonderful he s very observant of my expression and can tell when even the slightest thing is off constantly make sure i m okay and ha not hurt me at all however one thing he doe a lot is swear that he s told me something before even though i have no memory of it he always tell me i don t listen which is exactly what my narcissistic ex would always tell me there are a few time where he s started to tell me the story again and i remember but there are time i have no memory of it whatsoever he ll say remember how i told you about random person and i have no idea who he s talking about admittedly i have always struggled with paying attention when people are talking though i m good at pretending i am my brain just zone out halfway through their story this happens in class with friend etc i don t want to jump to the conclusion that he s attempting to gaslight me but i am starting to question myself and my listening skill just wanted another opinion on this,1
my 21m girlfriend 21f wanted me to accompany her to a dog therapy session even though i didn t want to go i left after 15 minute and now she s very upset with me advice needed me and my girl both 21 are university student dating for around 9 month and our respective apartment building are super close to campus our school ha this thing where a bunch of people bring their dog and student or whoever can come and play with them or pet them it s kind of like a dog therapy session i guess it s soothing or stress relieving or something like that since we live so close to campus sometimes these session take place in our apartment building in our theatre room now i do not like dog at all when i wa a kid i wa attacked by a dog and i still have a large scar on my hip from when it bit me and i ve disliked them ever since and i think that they re smelly and shed too much hair but that s besides the point anyways since the beginning i ve made this very much clear to her cause she s a dog person and i know that if i hid that from her it could potentially cause strife later she understands and is okay with it we have a common love for many other pet other than dog on to the problem yesterday we had one of these such dog therapy session and it wa in my apartment building which we happened to be in she reeeeaaaally wanted to go now i didn t want to go for a few reason a i had grocery shopping to do b i had homework and studying to do c she also had studying to do for a huge test she ha on wednesday that she s been freaking out about for a while and i advised she study instead of go to this event d the aforementioned reason that i don t like dog i said i don t want to go cause of the aforementioned reason i said she can go on her own if she want but i d rather do the stuff i have to do she got upset which is another problem in itself she s very clingy codependent and sometimes it rub me the wrong way if i ever mention wanting to chill by myself for a bit then she take it personally and get super offended this is kind of a big deal because i m one of those people who need to spend time with myself every once in a while to be sane and i think she just doesn t understand this no matter how much i explain that it s not that i hate her or don t want to see her she begged me to go with her and i said okay i ll compromise and i ll go but i ll only stay for 15 minute then i have to go do everything i said i have to do she agreed so i went i swallowed my mild but very real fear of dog i put up with the dog trying to lick my face and shedding hair on me for 15 minute i didn t say a single word of complaint at all i left after 15 minute like i said i would she got super upset again and begged me to stay and i said i don t want to and left she ended up staying for around 2 and a half hour she texted me that she didn t appreciate what i did and that i should have been there to support her but i don t get it support her through what and we re both adult we both shit to do and life to live i didn t say this to her but anyways long story short she went back to her place instead of coming back to mine and she hasn t spoken to me or responded to my text so far could i have handled this better should i have just bit the bullet and dealt with my fear of dog or are we just incompatible i don t know tldr gf wanted me to come pet some dog and i didn t want to i went for 15 minute and left afterwards and she wa really upset afterwards also some codependency issue,0

my husband 33m need me 33f need me to shower before he go to sleep every day this is a somewhat stupid question but a small thing ha become an annoying thing and i m not sure how to get around it i m a night owl and my husband of 10 year is a light sleeper this usually isn t an issue but i shower at night and our water pipe i guess go right behind the wall of our bedroom this mean that my husband can t sleep if i am showering he already wear earplug and ha a white sound machine to dampen all other noise but the shower noise can t be blocked out there are no other shower in our house is it unreasonable for me to resent the fact that i have to shower before he go to sleep every day for the rest of our life sometimes i go out after work and stay out late ish leading him to wake up when i shower leaving him irritated and me feeling guilty lately he s been trying to go to sleep earlier which mean i have to interrupt whatever i m doing at night go shower and come back to it which annoys me because i have completionist tendency but i can t shower immediately coming home because i m the one who start dinner and walk the dog also showering in the morning is not an option because he think it s gross to bring all your day shit into bed i would love to be a more generous spouse and shower at some consistent time that doesn t wake my husband up it it stupid to feel oppressed by all these time constraint tl dr husband need me to shower before he go to sleep and i resent the demand on my time,0
my last post were in poor taste i ve received a lot of message saying i am baiting this behavior and you guy are not wrong this is my first time in 6 year sharing my experience and yes i went about getting the video in all the wrong way i recognize this we are both toxic towards each other and in the beginning i wa very combative because i have never had anyone speak to me in such a way nonetheless get physical again this is all very new to me and i probably went about it all wrong and i am sorry for portraying this situation so irresponsibly i hope you all understand this is not to seek attention or validation but i need somewhere safe that he doesn t know about to keep my video and photo just be kind in your word even though i wa a dumbass about my approach,1

i 35f think my husband 38m of ten year is cheating on me i 35f have reason to believe my husband of 10 year 38m is cheating on me a few year ago i discovered some deleted google voice text exchange with a girl he had sex with before he met me i could only read part of the conversation but i could tell by the context that they had deep personal discussion i confronted him about this at the time and his reaction wa getting mad at me mocking me for being upset and paranoid he wa never that contrite never cried or acted very sad about it he explained the text away by saying that she wa bipolar and would text him during random episode of mania and he wa just trying to help her i have always trusted him and had no reason to believe he wa lying so i accepted his explanation and i never saw any other text exchange between them our relationship had been fine and loving up until earlier this year when he confessed to me that one night when he wa drunk he tried to kiss my best friend being a wonderful person she wa pissed and told him he needed to go to bed a few day later he told me he wa kind of tearing up about it i forgave him a it wa a drunken mistake and he s never been unfaithful to me before the only person who continually brings it up is him and i do get tired of comforting him because technically i m the victim in the situation and yet i have to do ton of emotional labor trying to assure him that everything is fine he ha always been a good husband and loving i would say we are soul mate because we connect on so many level and i am so deeply in love with him attracted to him and i genuinely admire him a a person we have two kid together the only problem we have had over the year other than these situation i ve mentioned is that when we do fight he can be unbelievably cruel he s verbally abusive he will leave and abandon me and if he s mad at me he will shun me for day before talking to me it s incredibly cruel and traumatic for me but since it doesn t happen very often and everything else is good between u i always forgive it when it happens yesterday new year s day we were just fine having a happy jovial morning we were waiting for ubereats to deliver our hangover burger it wa about noon so we were both pretty hungry he wa getting irritated with our four year old for being annoying and crawling all over him i got the child occupied so he could have a break and i wa sort of acting like i wa nervous because i perceived him to be in a sudden bad mood he called me out for this and wa very irate at me for being nervous it wa weird and sudden i suggested we eat and maybe then we d feel better but he said he wa going to do some work from home and refused to eat i begged him to just eat and hit the reset button the fight escalated and he said he wa leaving for the day in a moment of weakness and stupidity i threw the burger in the trash out of anger he slammed a bunch of door and said he wa leaving i begged him to just stay and i d get more food he screamed at me to leave him alone so i left with the kid to get more food and asked him to just calm down and we could start over with new food when i got back when i returned he wa gone i sent him a bunch of text message indicating that i wa super upset the abandonment stuff trigger some childhood trauma for me and he s known this for year sometimes i feel like he doe it knowing how much it hurt me because he like to see me in pain it s something i need to work on in therapy i know he told me that he wa at work even though he told me the day before that he didn t have very much work and no one wa in the office that day anyhow then my iphone gave me a message that location sharing wa turned off i thought it wa really strange that he would do that and i m not sure if he knew that turning it off would notify me i messaged him and asked him why he did that he told me to fuck off that he wa going to block me and told me to not be so paranoid one thing that he didn t realize is that he didn t turn off location sharing for his icloud account associated with his email address he only turned off the sharing with his phone i could see that he wa at a park in a town about 15 minute away he wa there for five hour i knew he wasn t at work he said i could go to his office and see his truck but that is meaningless to me because all that mean is that his truck wa parked in the lot why not just turn on location sharing again and prove to me that he s at work i didn t disclose to him that i knew he wasn t where he said he wa but i did take screenshots i don t know if this is horribly invasive and shitty of me but i ordered a vehicle tracker my plan is to track his truck and see if i can catch more lie he s always working late so it would be really easy for him to deceive me i don t know if tracking him is a really shitty thing to do i m not the jealous type but i just need to know how far this go i want to try to figure out who he is with and what he is doing it make me wonder if the reason he is always so cruel to me when we fight is because maybe he doesn t respect me and ha been cheating on me all these year when i confronted him about the text with that girl before he told me that if he wanted to text someone secretly i d never find out because he know way to secretly text when i found those text before i could tell he deleted much of the conversation it s not reassuring to me that his response to the situation wa that he could be even more deceitful if he wanted i am so heartbroken for all of these reason i m putting together everything over the year the cruelty when he s mad the few incident of borderline infidelity that he wa caught on this hiding of his location i love this man with all my heart other than the thing i ve mentioned our relationship is so perfect like 90 of the time he is an amazing father an outstanding member of our community he is well liked and respected by all i am so heartbroken because i ve given him the best of my love for over a decade i ve been a very good wife and it never seems like he give back the same amount of love when he can be so cruel to me i m not perfect but i think i m a great partner i m just devastated so my question are do i go ahead with the tracker it seems like a shitty thing to do but i want to know for sure if he s stepping out on me before i confront him i already know that he turned off location sharing and wa not where he said he wa especially because he wouldn t turn it back on which is a huge red flag to me but i feel like it s kind of crazy to put a tracker on his car my other question is how doe one deal with a broken heart i ve had breakup before but they were after shorter relationship and it wa after mutual devolving in the relationship over time i ve never been so head over heel for someone for a decade and now i m faced with the fact our relationship ha been a lie and might be over i don t even know where to begin ending a relationship with someone i love so much have kid and a house and a whole life with i m just sitting here cry and trying to be strong for my kid thank you for any help you can give me amp x200b tl dr my husband is most likely cheating on me should i track his car how do i deal with a broken heart,0
do you think outing my abusive ex will give me any closure or will i just look crazy and petty so i ll keep it short i wa in an extremely psychologically and physically abusive relationship from 16 21 when i got out i only told a few close friend i had a lot of shame i wa traumatized and needed time to process it he kept all our mutual friend and spread lie about me turning them against me i wa living in a new city going to school and with amazing new friend and convinced myself it would be cruel to ruin his reputation and take away his friend by telling everyone the truth about him 9 year later and i have c ptsd from this experience i still wake up with nightmare all the time i m happily married but i really suffered all through my 20 because of this meanwhile he still ha all the same friend including several woman who are staunch feminist who have no idea what he did to me by all account he ha a wonderful life i know i shouldn t feel vengeful but it make me so angry that he never faced any ramification even though i know that s my fault for not saying anything i fantasize all the time about reaching out to those old friend and telling them the truth but i don t know if i would just be opening old wound and if i should just let him have a good life and hope he s grown up the whole metoo thing really messed me up because it made me feel so cowardly and weak for not naming my abuser any advice appreciated,1
why woman don t report abuse if you read any of my post about my journey handling the trauma and abuse you ll find that i m dealing with court a well i ve had the da lie to me so much that i do not trust them the police just told me that they have a video of my abuser admitting to assaulting me and stalking me yet the da doesn t think that s enough to go to trial with they said that i m the issue with this case not the man who assaulted me and shot a gun off pretending to kill himself in front of me not only that but they said it s my fault he s stalking me because i have social medium i don t post where i go or what i do he s stalked me on two dating apps and ha gotten away with it even though there s a no contact order i m so done there s no way woman can report abuse anymore because the court system is a joke or a the officer so kindly said they are bullshit,1
bf 34 is quitting weed suddenly i 28f don t feel ready to do the same yet hi not sure if this is relationship or drug advice but the former is more important to me so here we go bf and i have been weed smoker for a while we ve been living together for 2 year we smoke daily not too much 3 joint a day shared i ve been smoking like this since i m 20 he got back to smoking after we got together 3 year ago but he ha a long story with drug addiction in general he hasn t touched anything harder than weed since we re together we ve been talking about quitting and getting our shit together for a long time because we were both unemployed and in a bad mental state i found a stable job a few month ago he s going to launch his business we moved to a new city and got a nice place i d say we re in a much better spot than 6 month ago now but he s still really stressed out about our situation because he s not making money yet and there s been a ton of change in our life since last summer i like to smoke in the evening it help me relax after work and before going to bed we agreed we would stop smoking weed when we start thinking about baby because i don t want to smoke while pregnant that would be in 1 2 year and we settled for reducing our weed intake over a few month now 4 day ago out of nowhere he started to say no when i wanted to pas him the joint he hasn t smoked since without even saying anything about it this morning he finally talked about it saying he wa feeling withdawal symptom and that he would never touch a joint ever again he wa very adamant about it being an awful thing i 100 support him i m impressed by his resolution but i don t feel ready to quit so suddenly we re out of weed now and i don t dare talking about buying some more i feel like he would look down on me and disapprove strongly or that i would betray him i m okay with going a few day without smoking but thinking about my last joint being the last one i ever smoked is impossible to me and i think quitting against one s will is a bad idea ha anyone here experienced a similar situation would he be right to resent me for continuing to smoke how do you think i should proceed if i want to keep this relationship in good shape and quit smoking weed the way i intended to quit step by step tl dr long time weed smoker couple bf stopped smoking suddenly but i don t feel ready i don t want to antagonize him by not quitting today thanks for advice,0
my 30 f boyfriend 34 m of 11 month just discovered he ha no saving no life plan at all and can t even articulate anything he might want in his future i think it s a deal breaker but i m stuck mid medical recovery for next couple month with him brief back story i m a successful it engineer who wa dating married to a man also a successful it engineer for 12 year prior to april 2018 i met him at 18 and divorced him at 29 he had borderline personality disorder i casually dated from june 2018 until january this year so you can say i have had little dating experience and skewed view on normal i met chad january this year he wa total opposite of my abusive ex kind compassionate said thing to build me up instead of tear me down more relaxed an amazing artist etc he wa a breath of fresh air at the time and i wa kind of over the casual dating thing so we slept together after a couple date and he asked me to be his gf i said yes i never combined finance with my ex husband because i paid for almost every single thing and just never saw the point my parent fought over finance a lot too i bought our now mine house i wa only one who contributed to retirement i paid for all our vacation usually nice one several time a year etc a long a he paid his own bill and credit card and didn t mess up my credit we just didn t talk about money product of my raising i guess since i started paying my parent bill at 16 i didn t see much wrong with this at the time but i don t want that life again so when meeting chad i never asked him about his finance he work in a hole in the wall music store and i know he can t make much more than minimum wage i have a lower paying job than i used to and live on one income so finance are more tight than they used to be but i still make probably 3 4x what chad make so i just pay for most stuff i ve really encouraged his art he ha build custom thing that could easily sell for decent money but he lack confidence and is more interested in video game than pursuing it anymore it s started to wear on me because i had a couple medical procedure with no pay and have some debt now first time in my life i ever had credit card debt so i ve started being more in need of him paying for little thing when we go out he ha always tried to pay when he could maybe like 6 meal or so since we ve been dating but he just ha no money vacation are out i paid over 1k for a brief trip for him shortly after we met because i really wanted him to go but i can t afford to do that anymore he s been staying at my place to help me with recovery for over a month now i ve been covering almost all food and obviously utility and it s hard esp not bringing in normal money he is really loving and helpful though exceptionally so he definitely try to make up for lack of money i appreciate him for that a lot it ha made me think more longterm with him because i value those particular quality highly in a mate so i started asking some pretty basic question what doe he want in his future what are his career goal doe he have a 401k etc i ve been completely blown away by what i ve learned and i really don t think there is a future at all now he ha never heard of compound interest he ha no saving like 0 and in fact ha missed month of bill at a time just the last 6 month and is struggling to pay late fee he ha a low 500 600 credit score mine is 780 he ha never invested in retirement saving and ha no interest in doing so just say he ll work til he dy or become a stay at home dad if he ever ha kid excuse me ha no life plan no drive to get out of his minimum wage job etc i ve been trying to get him to formulate a 2 year loose plan for week all i get is i don t know he can t articulate what his skill are to find a better job and after week of thinking about it ha absolutely nothing he say he can see for the future except he want to be with me just say he doesn t know because he s not in a spot he can afford to think about the future what i ve asked about his art and he just say it d be great if he became suddenly independently wealthy and could do it for fun but if it s for money it take the fun out of it ug hell we ve had a total of 4 day off together that vacation early in since we met and i m tired of it he hate his job they treat him poorly and he kill himself there for no good reason yet won t apply anywhere else i can t travel anymore because he can t go with no money or time off and get mopey if i want to the other day i bought two ticket to a concert for my favorite band a big city over to go to with a good friend chad doesn t like this band and can t even be sure until the week of it two month away if he could even attend he expects me to cover a 200 ticket for him just because he want to go with me if he can get the day off my friend is paying me for the second ticket and ha the day off and absolutely love this band a much a me this is unacceptable to me in term of the money i can t afford to buy him everything esp for a show he ha no interest in actually seeing he is an amazing human and i really love him but at 34 he just fails at being an adult at 23 i had a job working for a fortune 500 company have invested money smartly with over 2x my salary saved own my own house own my own 2017 car outright save 12 of my salary for retirement i wish it could be more and have goal and plan for my future i want a family in the next 2 3 year and want to travel and do fun thing before kid but i do not want to be the main breadwinner while trying to be a mom and i really don t want to forgo travel because of a partner crappy minimum wage job i understand not everyone is going to be a successful a i am my career choice is high paying but i need some kind of equality or at least some plan to improve a crappy situation or ability to work with any of my actual goal at this point i m really really depressed i love this man but how can we have a future i mean i m really trying to help him here figure stuff out but i feel he expects me to really do most the work while he spends most his free time on video game he try to contribute in help where he can t financially so i know he is making an effort but it s not enough i don t want to not retire or travel or do the thing i love because my partner s bad life choice or lack of planning he embodies so many of good quality though i haven t found in other people it s confusing i still have several month of actual recovery to go through and a break up is going to be super messy and really unhealthy for me i feel absolutely horrible at this and stuck i don t know what to do right now i don t have any real living family left shy of an addict sister who i don t speak with so i m in a vulnerable position right now but i don t want to just wait until i m recovered enough to not cause damage to myself to break up either that feel like a crap thing to do what do i do here is there any chance i can make this work i don t think so but maybe i can help him get his stuff together if not how do i navigate ending it tl dr i m a successful engineer with a lot of goal and a life plan boyfriend is helping me through a long medical recovery i started to see longterm potential and asked some basic question his answer are deal breaker for me i think no saving no ambition to leave his minimum wage job literally not one thing he can say he want or see in the next two year shy of me this would make my goal of travel and family very difficult to achieve month more of recovery to go don t know how to salvage this relationship or how to navigate ending it while recovering i d need to wait until after,0

better person it might give him joy to hear how much he hurt me let me give some back story then maybe you guy can give me some advice i took a gap year between college and grad school i wa in a pretty bad place mentally ie struggling with pretty bad depression and anxiety feeling very lonely lacking self confidence etc i wa a 22f at the time i cant remmeber exactly but he wa probably about 23 our relationship started out perfectly fine with no red flag it wa pretty great for the first couple month i had slept around a little in college but wanted to stop doing so so i waited quite a while for what i m used to to have sex with this guy we were probably dating for a month or two before doing so i started noticing some jealous tendancies of him but didn t really think much of it i had my own trust issue and got jealous pretty easy so i kinda let it slide it slowly became more and more i started noticing that he would get wayyy to drunk and out of control way to often when we went out he would always be blackout drunk and just doing dumb shit he would throw his house garbage can on the sidewalk and dumb garbage everywhere because he thought it wa funny just dumb shit like that my first red flag wa when we were drunk and went out to get pizza after and we were walking home and i said something he didn t like and he grabbed the leftover pizza box out of my hand and chucked it into the wood it wa literally almost the rest of a pizza and it wa from a gormet pizza place and it wa pretty expensive it wasnt a 5 pizza were talking like a 40 pizza plus i wa really excited for the left over other little incident followed but i never thought much of it a few week later we were at the bar when a former fwb of mine wa there my former fwb wa really drunk and trying to talk to me so i told my boyfriend i would like to go to a different bar he asked why and i wanted a relationship build on honesty so i said my former fwb is here he ha tried to talk to me a couple time i think he may try to start shit with you so i think it would be best we leave he then proceeded to ask me who it wa and pretty much made me tell him so i did he knew this guy and did not like this guy and he absolutely flipped a shit on me he walked away from me went into the bar bathroom and started texting instead of saying it to my face me horrible thing telling me i wa a slut and a whore etc i wa very drunk so i left the bar to extract myself from the situation i had been in an abusive relationship before so i learned that it wa best to extract myself i texted him and told him i left the bar and wa going back to his house i had been planning to spend the night there a we pregamed there and i left my apartment and car key there my car an overnight bag etc i went to his house and wa just going to sleep on the couch and drive home in the morning when i wa sober i could have called an uber but honestly i lived in a pretty sketchy city and didn t feel safe ubering by myself late at night he sent me about 20 text telling me i wa a slut and a whore and that my parent should be ashamed of me etc he then told me that if he got home and i wa still there i would be sorry so i called a friend at about 3 am and thank god she came and picked me up and drove me home before he got home i wa absolutely devastated i bawled hysterically all night he seemed so tender and loving and caring and it just absolutely shook me to my core my mental state wa so bad at the time that i actually believed him for the thing he said i believed him that i wa a whore just because i had had a fwb i believed that my parent should be ashamed of me for having a sex drive i needed to go pick back up my car the next day so my roommate dropped me off back at his place to get it when i pulled up with her he wa standing outside waiting he told me he had other thing of mine inside and the only way i would get them back wa if i gave him a chance to talk to me and apologize i wa in a very fragile mental state and feeling so depressed and down so i stupidly went inside with him hoping he could somehow explain his behavior to me he broke down cry and just begged and begged me for forgiveness he gave me some huge sob story about how his gf before me cheated on him and he ha really bad trust issue because of this he also tried to tell me that he had gotten her pregnant at one point and she had an abortion and he didn t want her to and it really fucked him up mentally because he claimed to be very religious and wa very against abortion and yada yada yada you get the point he gave me some huge sob story about why he called me a slut and whore etc he promised me that he would go to counseling and also confessed to me he had depression and promised me he would go see his pcp and get on medication for this so i wa a fucking idiot and told him i would give him another chance if he promised to never do this again and if he would go to counseling and get on medication i also told him i didn t want to drink around him again until he could prove that he wa better well he went to his pcp who prescribed him an antidepressant he took it for maybe about 5 or 6 day then told me he didn t need it he claimed to me he went to counseling several time and told me a he wa going to these appointment but in retrospect i should have probably asked for actual proof i never saw actual proof just him telling me he went thing were better for about 2 or 3 week but then thing started to slowly build up again he spent the night at my apartment one night i left for work in the morning before he woke up while i wa at work i got a call from him i could tell he wasn t happy he go i found condom in your nightstand why do you have condom in your nightstand don t you know what that say about you that is so disgusting you shouldn t have those i reminded him that he had condom in his nightstand a well and that we used them for sex and that i also want to have them to protect myself he told me well it fine for me to have them because i m a guy but clearly since you have them you re anticipating sleeping around so of course i try to tell him all the reason he wrong etc and i realized there wa no chance i wa going to change his viewpoint so since i wa at work and needed to like actually work i told him i needed to go and hung up i check my phone later in the day have a million text from him telling me how dare i hang up and telling me how there is no world in which i should have hung up etc the next time i see him he asks me how many people i have slept with i told him that in light of recent event of him calling me a slut i didn t really feel it wa appropriate to disclose how many to him i reassured him i had been tested for std right before i began sleeping with him that he wa the only one i have been with since and everything wa negative he told me that he couldnt continue to be in a relationship with me unless i told him so i did mine 13 not really important but just for clarification sake he in turn told me his 15 which wa higher than mine i personally don t care about number i don t think it defines somebody i am aware that everyone ha a past including myself so his number really didnt bother me honestly most of my friend had slept with double the amout of people i did the university i went to is very much a hook up oriented university it a major party school with about 50 000 student my number wa by no mean high in the context of my university i had several friend whose number were 40 he absolutely couldn t get over my number even though his wa higher every single day he would just be like i can t believe how many people you ve been with and thats so many i told him that this wa exactly why i didn t want to tell him and that he wa to never belittle me for my number again he dropped it for a while then he started texting his friend the statement would you sleep with a girl thats been with a black dude before the fwb i had mentioned earlier wa african american i am white for clarification sake of the story i am very accepting of every culture race and religion so somebody being a different race than me ha never deterred me i wa attracted to this guy he became my fwb anyways he would text his guy friend that question then screenshot his conversation with them and send it to me most of his friend were a lot like him total alcoholic piece of shit so they would all say really hurtful thing he would send it to me and be like see i m right and they agree you are so disgusting for sleeping with that guy i would never fucking let you mother my child also i have always been a fan of rap music so i would frequently play it when i wa with him he liked hip hop and most rap a well but he told me that the fact i liked rap music said a lot about me and clearly showed that i wa a whore i believed him i felt ashamed for my musical preference and didn t want to listen to music i genuinely enjoyed because i wa embarrassed this type of behavior continued for several month and continued to progress he would call text me screaming at me anytime i spent time with family or friend anytime i had fun and he wasn t there he would do everything in his power to ruin my time i wanted so badly to end thing but i wa so fucked up mentally by this point and honestly so scared of him that i didn t know what to do we had a huge group of mutual friend and i wa so terrified he would ruin my self image and spread all these horrible rumor about me to my friend if i left him so i felt so stuck i knew i wa leaving for grad school soon and figured getting distance would help i moved about 6 hour away for grad school while still dating him my first semester he came down to visit 2 or 3 time and whenever he came down thing were fine but when he wasnt there thing were shit i usually got out of class around 5 pm everyday but sometimes class would go over or i would be walking home with classmate and didn t want to be rude and answer my phone while walking with them he would call me every single day at exactly 5 pm and if i didn t answer he would absolutely blow up on me he would call me miss communication and tell me that i wa clearly cheating on him if i spent all day in the library studying for exam he would tell me that he didn t believe me and that i wa probably cheating on him and not studying day before big exam he would always start some huge fight and i would spent the day before the exam fighting with him and bawling my eye out instead of studying at this point we had been dating for about 8 month somehow i still managed to 4 0 that semester which took and incredible amount of strength i wa finally 6 hour away from him made some amazing new friend got on antidepressant and wa so proud of myself for kicking as in grad school i decided i wa going to end thing with him and i did he hysterically bawled when i broke up with him and told me he wa going to kill himself i told him good luck with that and hung up and ignored every single call or text from him after that about two month after i broke up with him i got a 10 page handwritten letter in the mail from him he had my address at school from when he came to visit the letter explained in extreme detail how sorry he wa how much of an angel i wa and how much he fucked up he said he had been back on medication regularly going to counseling started boxing to help cope with his issue and got involved with his church again he begged and begged in the letter for another chance and told me i wa an angel sent from above to help fix him and make him a better man i proceeded to throw the letter away and laugh he messaged me asking if i got it and i told him yes but it doesn t change anything and blocked him and haven t talked to him since i am doing much better now but still do struggle i finished grad school with a 4 0 have an amazing job that i love making great money i have a boyfriend who i have been with for a while who is extremely loving kind and patient he know my number and ha absolutely no problem with it didn t even bat an eyelash when i told him and ha helped me to heal tremendously love that i like rap music love that i am a sexual being this all being said i am still pretty depressed and struggle daily i frequently feel numb and cry for no reason i feel dissociated from my body often and have a hard time connecting with others and trusting others i have day where it take me all the strength in the world to even get up out of bed to pee or eat i usually only eat one meal a day and am slowly becoming very underweight luckily my current boyfriend is understanding but i have a hard time wanting to have sex because i frequently feel guilty for wanting sex i take antidepressant still but it just isn t enough my new insurance kick in soon and i plan to start seeing a counselor therapist once i have insurance and i know that i need to i do plan to a very large part of me want to write out all of this and send it to my emotionally abusive ex to let him know how much he hurt me but a i said in the title i don t know if this a good idea those of you who have been strong enough to leave an abusive ex how did you cope year down the road even though you were doing better considering sending a letter to him even though it been 2 5 year just to let him know how shitty he wa and how much he hurt me i don t hope to accomplish anything by it and i have no desire to ever have him in my life ever again but i just think it might help me emotionally to tell him how awful of a human he is tl dr considering sending letter to emotionally abusive ex to let him know how shitty of a human he is bad idea should i just talk to counselor instead,1

update i 24m think my girlfriend 25f is cheating on me to see the original story i ve linked it so update a of yesterday i asked her how come she had grown so distant she didn t give me any sort of answer so i just asked is there another guy i got her to confess she had been seeing a guy she met on tinder she told me that i just wasn t the one for her she got no satisfaction from me anymore and that i wa just a weight in her life that kept her down for the record i haven t stopped her from pursuing her dream career even though we sacrificed an income for her to do so i have always been respectful of her need and want i like to think i have been a decent boyfriend to her she asked for an immediate break up because she wa gonna move some stuff into the new guy house i told her that wa fine but she had to get her stuff out at once i didn t want her to come back two and three time a week to get her thing she want nothing to do with our pet so i am keeping the cat and giving the dog to my mom who could use some company since my dad passed away a few month ago it s really hard to see how cold she wa no tear or sense of regret so tomorrow saturday she is taking all of her stuff in her dad s pickup truck and moving to that guy s house i asked her how long this had been going on and she said 2 month it s a little bit nauseating because we had still been sleeping together in that time i appreciate those of you looking out for me telling me to use condom thanks but we were doing that natural family planning where she tracked her fertile day and all that so we weren t gonna get pregnant unless we actually tried i m sad because this is a woman i ve grown to love and essentially have grown with a an individual i just can t believe how much she s changed over these past couple of week hopefully she find what she truly want and is happy tldr my girlfriend i suspected of cheating on me confessed we broke up and she is moving in with her new guy,0
how do i 29f ask my mil 60f to buy my clothes for me i want to start by saying this is a champagne problem but i also am very stuck my partner s family is close knit and very very wealthy i grew up working class and in an abusive household so marrying into such a stable and loving family wa a dream i can t emphasize enough how welcoming they have been i always joke that if i hadn t married into this family i would have asked them to adopt me all of that being said class anxiety is still a thing and i am always very self conscious about how limited my experience with travel luxury etc is compared to my husband and his family especially because i am in grad school and still on a strict budget not well off financially the problem is this my in law have invited u all on a luxury vacation for christmas and his mother pulled me aside last time i saw her and let me know that i will need 5 7 conservative evening dress for all the event they have planned for this trip she then said she would be happy to pay for these for me just let her know she ha made this kind of offer before but never follows up on it she never followed up on giving me the money this time either and i m getting nervous about the trip i ve been on trip with them before and felt conspicuously poorly dressed compared to all the rich people around me and it made the whole vacation embarrassing and uncomfortable i think i would need to spend minimum 1500 to look presentable even if i got used thing and tailored them myself i know appearance are important to them so showing up underdressed would be taken a disrespectful and so that doesn t feel like an option either my partner and i have separate finance for non shared expense ex we have a shared account for thing like grocery and rent but separate account for saving and personal expense he doesn t really get why this is a problem mainly because he can wear the same three suit to everything and it s not weird he doesn t get why i need to get new clothes even after his mother said something to me directly my question is should i reach out and ask my mil to help with the expense after she offered i m just not sure if this is one of those thing it s reasonable to ask or if she wa just offering to be polite i don t want to overstep or take their generosity for granted but i also don t want to spend two week feeling and looking uncomfortable and underdressed around a bunch of rich people what should i do tl dr my very wealthy and kind in law are asking me to spend a lot of money on clothes that i can t afford should i follow up on their offer to help or would that abuse their generosity,0
is this early stage of abuse sometimes when he ll get angry enough he ll stand over me or push me real hard to where i ll fall over or hurt myself on whatever he push me onto i may be annoying or i ll have an attitude when he get angry at me for making a stupid everyday mistake but i ve never physically hurt him it almost seems like he s holding back worse,1

final update my gf ha never had a healthy relationship with any man original post update post amp x200b forcing myself to complete this saga the tingling catharsis jolting within my knuckle irritates me fingertip striking each key vigorously with a palpable disdain that bitter taste of shame i had swallowed 6 month ago regurgitating itself from the depth of my esophagus a the machination of failed endeavor are made tangible for the sake of closure it took me three month to find a place line it all up and execute my leap into normalcy i became distant avoid ant preferring isolation over integration i wa slow to trust again but soon moved into a shared 2bd apartment it wa nice but small gave away three room of nice furniture this stuff these thing just get rid of it all of it artifact of a past that only exists in memory i no longer want them that surreal feeling of the environment melding into the oddly familiar i had changed i had grown but in those two year i lived in a bubble that preserved something in me awaiting universal equilibrium feel like sliding down a staircase in a rowboat while standing on marble nothing seems normal i must be estranged funny in the last post i failed to mention how i sold my share of the house and the company to her for a fraction of it s worth a price she couldn t refuse she is now in full control of a leaking ship lurching towards a self fulfilling destiny and she is on top of the world i wont get into the detail but i m fully absolved from all responsibility i moved on and adjusted slowly steadily without incident we still text i learned she had cashed out the remaining equity in the home essentially bankrupting the company took a 7 day trip to morocco to re center herself came back and concluded the slow ritualistic burning of whatever profit wa left the house did sell for what she wanted but there wa no equity she wa lucky to break even but the investor ate a 700k talk about disgraced she liquidated whatever wa left and moved in with her mom no joke we still talk the bad blood ha thinned enough to share a cup of coffee but she find moment to purge any caustic vapor bubbling under the skin she gained 25lbs and life with her mom growing with bitterness letting her former glory slip away some people are just happy with being pessimistic asshole not this guy though i m far more tempered now the experience left me with a bittersweet feeling that i had grown while lacking tangible accomplishment at least i didn t go broke or get sued or locked up for some impulsive thrashing out i ve been dating again and growing my new career i do miss her cat we were bro s i would do it all again same outcome same everything i m staying in tough with the ex too she s not lost just dense this whole ordeal the choice she made the mania amp insanity wa her hitting rock bottom she see that recognizing her trauma a an inhibitor of close relationship with men there is hope for her to heal if desired but i wasn t meant to be a part of that also that woman made a fucking man out of me so cheer to that i think that s everything thanks for reading,1

me 38m with my gf 34f together 2 year at a stalemate on the topic of kid i know this is a common problem brought up here but i want to be sure i ve explored all avenue before there are consequence i do not want child my so ha said in the past she doesn t think she doe but a time go on she is showing sign of that not being true and i fear she s only a much a no a she is in order to keep u together when we first moved in together i scheduled a vasectomy when at my doctor s office at the time i didn t think this wa a big deal because i ve always been so vocal on not wanting child that i thought we were on the same page we were friend before we got together and one of the deciding factor for me to get together with her and move to her city wa knowing we agreed on this topic i wa quite wrong she didn t react to the vasectomy well at all she say that although she doesn t think she want kid she isn t ready to make that decision 100 i agreed to postpone the procedure this wa a little over a year ago now the topic of kid ha come up a few time during our relationship always with the same lack of result she want me to compromise on the topic whereas i see it a a compatibility problem and there s no room for compromise she seems to be ok with the idea that we ll deal with this problem down the road should it come up whereas i don t think either of u should invest more time into a relationship that will fail she take offense to my view on that and focus on how devastating the breakup will be now and doesn t think about the one down the road recently we were abroad on a work cation and the topic came up again i get frustrated when this happens because it s always the same conversation where she prof to me she is not at all accepting of my answer during this last talk she suggested maybe i could act a an uncle to the baby i don t think this wa really a suggestion she wa making but rather trying to get me to bend and give her hope i ll change my mind at the end of it she smiled at me and said a a compromise just please re think your position that solidified my opinion that she is leaning more and more to the want kid and simply doesn t accept my answer a fact it s disappointing in the next year she and i talking about buying a house but i cannot push forward in that regard while feeling so unstable in the relationship my biggest fear is she will accidentally get pregnant and will either 1 not keep the baby and resent me for it or 2 keep the baby and i ll resent her for it so i feel my only option is to reschedule the vasectomy and force her to choose the thought make me sick but it s better now than further down the road tl dr my girlfriend isn t accepting that i don t want kid and i want to get a vasectomy before i invest more into the relationship if i do that she will probably opt to break up now are there any other option,0

my 29m girlfriend 45f and i both slept with two other people when our relationship wa open in ther beginning after 8 month i m not happy with her having been attracted to other people i should mention that i am going through a really bad depression and my self esteem is really low i think at the time i suggested an open relationship because i didn t know if i wa attracted to her enough now that i m in love with her those other girl don t even hold a candle to her my girlfriend is way more attractive than them to me it feel objectively true but for some reason for woman i think it s different it hurt to think that after we had sex she wa still able to lust after two other people i strongly feel like woman can t have sex with someone other than their current sexual partner unless they are more attracted to those other people she had known those other two people longer than she knew me her and i had sex the first night we met she consistently tell me those other guy don t even come close to me and that she find me much more attractive and that she didn t orgasm with them but i just really can t fucking believe that she lusted enough to sleep with them just once like she wanted to experience these hot men while i m just decent boyfriend sex not enough to keep her interest in me sexually it feel damning to the relationship she told me one guy wa rough with her and that she didn t like that but most woman really enjoy that i keep thinking if their penis felt better to her whether they were more manly she s attracted to physique a lot and mine is pretty fucking average since they were her age it also hurt that she can have one night stand and enjoy them that she s so sexual that she would be willing to have casual sex even after we had already had sex she didn t just want casual sex with me i m not hot enough for casual sex tl dr girlfriend exploited open relationship had sex with two other people mean she wanted them for casual swx and me for relationship sex which mean i m not hot to her and they were it hurt because she s definitely hot to me but it feel like she s settling for me,0

my f26 bf now ex m31 lashed out at me for mentioning my ex s when reassuring him my now ex went insane over what i thought wa a small fight it escalated and i wa wondering if i wa at fault triggering his insecurity some info he hate any mention of my ex s even when the context call for it i m not allowed to mention the term ex under any circumstance because it make him insecure so i tried my best not to do that unless i really have to also both of u have been cheated on before but he feel that we should never talk about it because it would mean our ex s have won two day ago the topic of our parent came up he wa worried about my parent comparing him to my ex s or liking them more i reassured him and said my first ex cheated on me and my second ex abused me a lot and also cheated emotionally so it s normal that he hate them he replied i see so i changed topic he ignored what i said and sent again you mention your ex s and all those thing like it s nothing and the more you talk about it the more they win and are empowered i told him are you for real i wa just trying to reassure you by explaining to you why my dad will never like them more than you i am not empowering them because i am over them and the hurt they have caused me they have no power over u i do not let them get to me i have left everything in the past he ghosted me for 25 hour after that even after i texted can we talk when he finally responded he said i told you to never mention or bring it up but you still do you get frustrated at me because you found a loophole and exception to the rule again my position stand a i do not like or fancy hearing about it because i in turn think about it and it make me incredibly insecure and uncomfortable no matter how dead they are to you or how little of importance they are you empowered them by conjuring them up again in my thought and now i spend the time thinking negative thought you don t listen you didn t learn and here i am again thinking of the same insecurity i have because you put them back into my head i replied you tell me you love me but you ghost me during a fight even though you know i have anxiety and you guilt trip me constantly i tried my best to reassure you and i brought up my ex s to reassure you that my dad will never like them more than you when i do something nice for you you ask me if i ve done that for anyone before which go against you being so adamant on not talking about my ex s it feel like you only bring it up when it suit you i guess this is it i don t think this is gonna work take care of yourself and i hope you work out your issue and become a happier person because you deserve happiness amp x200b this wa when he lashed out this wa his message wow you are a fucking real piece of work you bring up your ex s again and make it my fault that i m insecure when i fucking told you to not do it under any circumstance yet you find reason to bring them up again and what they did over and over again you wouldn t need to have to reassure me if you fucking listened the first million fucking time i told you to stop bringing them up or talking about it yet it s so goddamn hard for you to but it s mistake after mistake and you playing like you didn t know what you did or that talking about your ex s again would have rubbed me the wrong way one time wa enough for me to have explained it to you but her keep doing it it doesn t give me any semblance of reassurance or comfort that you had to explain it again so i know why your dad like me over the rest except you capitalized on that opportunity to fucking remind me for the billionth time the reason why i wa ghosting you is because you inevitably played the omg again card to me when you initiated it how fucking difficult is it to stop talking about your ex s when i told you so many goddamn time i just cannot wrap my head around why that is seemingly the most challenging task for you it would have avoided so many fight if you just put a fucking filter on your goddamn mouth but no you fucking burn these ex s into my fucking head and i can t get them out so thank you for actively making me insecure you think you are so much better than me because you reassure me all of the time if it weren t for your need to always bring up your fabulous fucked up past and tell me all about it or talk about guy all the fucking time you wouldn t need to even try to reassure me amp x200b i do not talk about my ex s all the time nor do i talk about other guy i only talked about my close guy friend including female one who he already know about wa it my fault for triggering his insecurity i get it that it might seem like a no brainer but his message made me second guess myself amp x200b tl dr my f26 bf now ex m31 lashed out at me for mentioning my ex s when reassuring him saying i triggered his insecurity by even mentioning them wa it my fault for even mentioning them at all,0

is my father really emotionally abusive and if so how do i put an end to this my dad is very high maintenance a me and my brother call it he wa beaten by his father when he wa young so i can t even be mad at him for being te way he is but he make me feel so inadequate in everything i do to be clear my dad ha never physically abused me we had everything we needed and wanted growing up bur i ll give some exemples of his behaviour amp x200b when my dad wa young he played basketball his abusive father never made it to any of his game zero interest so when i wa six he insisted i take up basketball too i sucked at basketball and hated every minute of it but he always seemed so happy to see me play and blackmailed me so that i wouldn t quit one more season and i ll get you that new gameboy you wanted when i wa 16 i finally had the gut to quit and he wa so disappointed he even cried and said how proud he wa of my friend who did keep playing amp x200b the attention always need to be on him when i got married he didn t feel well and went home early he doesn t like my husband probably because he doe stand up to him and constantly critices him when my daughter wa born he didn t talk to me for day because when he came to the hospital he wasn t the first to hold her same disapproval when i send a picture to my mom first or tell her something that i haven t told him yet when i bought a house without consulting him first he listed everything wrong with the house i seem to do everything wrong he then give me the silent treatment or act like a victim for day nobody love me what did i do wrong for my kid to treat me this way it s like he can t be happy for u unless we follow the road he ha planned for u amp x200b he continues to interfere in my life with the best intention i m sure for exemple he called the bank behind our back when my husband and i needed a loan for our house to make sure we were making the right decision my husband wa furious he also criticises every decision we make without consulting him kid school buying a car booking a holiday buying furniture whatever it is if we don t follow his advice it the wrong decision and he tell u over and over again sometimes he even offer to pay something for u if we do it his way my husband find this very difficult to deal with and i find myself stuck between them because somehow i still crave his aproval and don t want my dad to be upset amp x200b i also hate how he act to my mom she is the sweetest gentlest woman i know but he belittels her and put her down constantly she always tried to do what wa best for u but he wa so dominant in our upbringing that i get why she stopped standing up to him to keep the peace in our household to make thing worse a a child my brother and i often took my dad s side because that s where the present came from so she couldn t win amp x200b today my dad did something that make me feel like i really do need to stand up to him i booked a holiday just me my husband and our two kid my daughter wa super excited and told my dad and all he could say wa pff that place is full of mosquito her face killed me all her excitement vanished and it hit me that she feel the same way i do she craves his approval or some postive feedback now she doesn t even want to go anymore and even i am le excited about the trip and i know that he only said it because in the past we would go on holiday with my parent which he paid for so he could choose the destination but i really wanted a stress free holiday with just my husband and kid and now i feel so guilty i want to stand up to him but i don t want to hurt him but i definitely don t want my kid to feel like they need to constantly do what he want amp x200b am i overreacting or is this not a healthy relationship,1

my 34 m girlfriend 35 f is a slob kid are slob thinking about going out for a pack of smoke i need to preface this by saying that my mental state is heavily tied to my environment i m the type of guy who like thing clean and organized when the place i am living in is clean and organized i feel happier healthier and motivated i feel like my life ha structure this stem from being raised by a hoarder growing up my mother just left shit everywhere nothing wa ever organized she just accumulated thing after thing and my dad just stood there and let it happen any time i tried helping out by organizing thing she would get pissed off and yell at me she always said oh we re going to clean up next week then a week passed by and it wa the same old story it wa a if me trying to clean the mess wa undermining her i spent my day a a child in an unfinished basement no wall you could see the foundation and electrical wiring sitting on an old torn up couch fantasizing about how much better thing would be if they were new and clean and organized it wasn t like we didn t have money to make the house better all that money wa seemingly squandered on gambling or buying more and more item that brought little to no value to our life there wa shit everywhere and there wa nothing i could do about it i envied my friend when i went to their house and saw their wall were finished their furniture wa new and everything had it place fast forward to being an adult my apartment ha always been extremely organized and spotless i would consider myself a minimalist and find the le i have the happier i am i had been fairly satisfied with my living environment for a long time that changed a couple of week ago when i let my girlfriend move in with me my place ha always been so neat that one time she said it felt like a hotel or it wa cold and uninviting or it didn t look lived in maybe that wa true or maybe she wa just telling that to herself so she didn t have to face the fact that she herself is a lazy slob she ha always been the type of person who doesn t care about cleanliness and organization one time i took picture of her place and almost submitted it to a television show to see if they would do an episode on her dirty clothes all over the floor garbage bin overflowing old takeout food bag lying around there wasn t even a clean towel to dry your hand with in her washroom still in my mind i always had a clean place to come home to so i didn t really give a shit well me being the naive idiot that i am i thought that thing would be different if we ever lived together i figured i could help her to organize all of her stuff and put the necessary work in to keep thing clean and organized i have found out that not only wa i wrong but am now considering just packing up a few thing and leaving at first it seemed doable i put in a ton of work while she moved her stuff in i spent day just going through thing and making space and ensuring her thing were not simply tossed around everywhere this quickly became impossible to keep up with the more thing i organized the more shit she brought over not to mention that the current thing began becoming a mess a i found myself just cleaning up new mess and clutter of thing that i had originally tidied up and cleaned it seems like i m the only one who actually give a shit about not living in a pig pen i have lost all hope and motivation with her her 2 kid her dog and her cat i am spending more time cleaning up after other people and animal than getting actual work done it is like trying dig a ditch while someone else keep shovelling dirt into it my apathy and resentment is growing daily i ve tried telling her numerous time that i like living in a clean and organized environment it is now at the point where she just get upset and take everything personally every time i try and remind her so i have given up on trying that a well i don t know how much more of this i can take this wa my home and i no longer even want to be here i keep trying to think up excuse or place to go just to get out of here for an hour or two here and there my zest for life is slowly withering away to a place of non existence this might seem like i am over reacting but i don t want to live like this and have even considered just offing myself if something doesn t happen soon i am either going to go for a pack of smoke and never come back or hang myself in the bathroom i can t see myself ending this relationship because i ve never actually been with a woman who isn t a complete fucking slob and i ve been in at least 10 relationship in my life time tl dr girlfriend is a slob place is a mess and i can t handle it thinking of leaving,0
i wasn t feeling well one night and didn t want to send nude to my emotionally sexually physically abusive ex bf when he asked me for them and this is how he reacted i don t think i wa wrong ,1
today i leave i wa in a relationship for over a decade like most story it didn t start off a abusive but it did end up a abusive and now a we are coming to an end it is all hitting me with just how bad it wa yet he is still trying to make this my issue the recap it started with cheating accusation of course it never happened but i wa made to feel a though i had done something wrong so i made sure i never done anything wrong so i wouldn t hurt him again then my friend weren t really his type of people so we spend more time with his friend because that s what happens in relationship right we compromise and respect our partner then he wa going out all the time if i got upset it wa my fault if i put my foot down and had an issue i wa being a bitch and controlling him regardless of the fact he wa spending our rent money to party 5 night a week then came the physical abuse if something happened when he wa drinking it wa my fault because i shouldn t be upset when he is drunk and i can t blame him because he wa drunk and doesn t remember same for the sexual abuse we don t need to acknowledge it because he wa drunk and cannot remember then the lie i must certainly be crazy because 800 just disappeared he ha no idea how but it did he really did pay the rent it wa the agent mistake etc etc also i wasn t being controlled i wa allowed to do exactly what i wanted when i wanted even though every time i made plan he would disappear so i couldn t follow through we have kid so i couldn t just abandon them or if i wanted to do something it came at a cost i want to go do something i enjoy sure no problem but despite the fact he doe what he want when he want it is at that moment he ha to do this one thing at the exact same time i had organised my thing he did listen to me and care about me yet he missed the time where i said i wa sad or lonely or wanted to talk about thing he listened so much that after over a decade together he had no idea about thing i liked or wa interested in even when we split for a few month year ago and he never left me alone that wa because he loved me so much rather than him trying to control me even now a i am trying to end this relationship he won t leave because we are meant to work it out i am just being a coward throwing away our family rather than working through this he is going to change he know he didn t the 300 other time he said this but this time is different how mean i am for not believing him when he is trying so hard where is he meant to go how can he survive how hard is it going to be for our kid to force their dad out how it will all be my fault he is a great dad help cook and clean and take the kid out work hard how could i do this to him other men don t do a much a he doe so what s the problem sure he held a knife to me many time but it wa in the past why can t i just move on why do i have to keep bringing it up through all this i have stayed silent when i should have been screaming i feel the guilt out of all he say but every time i look at my life i see it wa never really mine it wa his i wa just allowed to take part in it sometimes he say all of this because he want to continue the relationship that work best for him not out of love or respect for me i had to take serious stock of what exactly our relationship wa where i failed where he failed and where we failed each other by letting this behaviour continue and it wa when i done this i realised no matter how many way i try to decipher it or work it out what wa real what is in my head that it is abuse it locked me into a place of guilt and shame and loneliness and hurt and relationship are meant to be the exact opposite of that even after many decade together it should be love and support and a mutual experience so let it be all in my head let it be my fault that our kid come from a broken home let everyone know how much of a cold heartless person i am to be so mean to him to throw him out on the street take his kid away i have not nor will i ever take away his right to our kid even if it s only for their sake let everyone blame me because i would rather that than to live like a prisoner again broken and empty i would rather never meet anyone again than to sleep in the same house a someone who turned my safe place into my own hellish nightmare i would rather sleep on the street than to sleep next to the man who made me feel a though i wa going to die that i deserved to die let me never see the sun again i would rather live in darkness than to feel so invisible so worthless so weak today i leave,1

i m36 don t think it s appropriate for my wife f35 to go out by herself and get drunk to the point where she ha to spend the night at a friend s house together over 9 year have 3 kid 7 6 and 3 we got into a fight the other night about her having too much to drink after getting off work i don t have any issue with her going out to have a few drink and socializing getting out of the house and away from the kid every now and then is important after our most recent fight about her staying out and accidentally drinking too much we agreed she would keep it to 2 drink if she went out after work that had been working good for a month or so until last weekend she call me up and say she is hanging out with a bunch of her friend and if i d mind if she had 1 more drink i tell her that s fine and she say she should be home around 1130 she call me around 11 and say that she had a 4th drink and is way too messed up to drive home and will be home at 1 30 or 2 00 at the absolute latest once she sobers up a bit she call me around 2 to tell me she should probably spend the night at a friend s house it take about an hour to make it home and she not sure she can drive i m really pissed at this point and tell her i want her to come home if you had 4 drink between 9 and 11 you should be able to drive home by 230 she say that she ll be home around 330 she finally managed to make it home at 330 and we got into a bit of a fight before going to bed we discussed it the next day and she told me that i wa being controlling by not letting her go out and have fun and not letting her spend the night at a friend s house i don t have a problem with her doing that if it s a planned thing but her going out and deciding to get drunk to the point where she can t drive home and then finding a friend to go home with just seems fucked up to me i m sure that we both have some issue here and it s not just one person s fault i wa in a relationship with an alcoholic who would pull shit like this constantly so i m not sure if i m overreacting or not i ve also gone out by myself in previous relationship and gotten fucked up and done all kind of messed up thing that sober me would never have done when i m out solo now i am always on control and never get to the point where i can t drive or would be making questionable choice i trust her and don t think she d cheat on me but there s a lot of other bad decision that drunk people make that don t involve cheating also this ha never been an issue before but had just started since she started this new bartending job looking for an outside perspective and some advice on our situation tldr wife think i m being controlling for telling her it s inappropriate to be going out and getting drunk all by herself,0

i m considering leaving my 30m girlfriend 31f over something she did over six month ago i could use some unbiased advice on this regarding a situation involving my girlfriend 31f and myself 30m so basically my father passed away this year he had been unwell for a few year but hit a pretty sudden decline fuck cancer god rest his wonderful soul shortly after i wa made aware that the cancer had spread from it s primary to multiple secondary location i had an opportunity to go and spend the weekend with my father just u two a his girlfriend wa going away for the weekend this wa an incredibly rare opportunity in the sense that looking back i can t remember the last time i had the opportunity 5yrs it wa obviously bittersweet because he wa unwell but i could tell he wa trying his best to make the most of it too on the saturday we decided to walk into town and get a bite to eat and a glass of wine or two my girlfriend wa staying in my apartment back home while i wa there in all honesty i don t remember why she stayed there wa a reason she asked to stay i e she needed some time out or something strange writing it i don t remember the reason though i ve had a drink so likely that anyway she decided to get really drunk in my apartment and started sending me text message early on in the evening about how she wa going to kill herself or word to that effect literally asking me the best way to do it and stuff then when i told her that i wasn t in a position to help her at all being 400km away i wa going to call her family or the police if she didn t explain herself she stepped back and started being a lot more covert but still referring to the same thing and it took my attention for the entire night even after dinner once we walked home and my father had gone to bed i wa calling her all worried and stuff that wa the last night i had just my father and i before thing went downhill shortly after after that it wa the whole family his partner group etc anyone that ha been through it know the morning after i text her concerned and she text me saying word to the effect of you need to come home now baby and when i drove home 6 hour i got in all concerned and she wa all i don t want to talk about it then i had to go out and get u dinner never once apologised for it would refuse to discus it till it wa eventually forgotten but now i am coming out of my grieving phase ever so slightly i m reflecting on it and starting to feel a sense of incredible resentment i just can t shift incredible resentment i feel like if i did that the guilt would just consume me if i took that from someone on top of that the day after the funeral she wa going to leave early and go home because she wa offended a nobody at the funeral knew her she felt like i hadn t told anyone about her when really these were people i hadn t seen myself in several year when we ve only been together for 2 5 year i explained to her that i had an interesting family dynamic separated parent etc lead to interesting dynamic but she wouldn t have it i had to take the day out after the funeral to take her out for dinner to bring her round so to speak i feel like it s been so long now it isn t valid you know the grief is running circle with my mind and i don t know if i m just looking for someone to blame for it doe that make sense maybe someone ha some advice on how to approach this i know she suffers from depression but refuse to tackle it practically short of me going and finding her a therapist myself i don t know if i have too much empathy or am being too cold not understanding her issue thanks for reading to confirm i wa driving home on the sunday either way i didn t leave earlier because of it maybe a couple of hour tl dr i feel my gf wa incredibly selfish during a time that should have been just about my father and myself on top of that she never seemed willing to discus it again and seemed to show no remorse even making his funeral about her instead of him,0

my 24f boyfriend 27m is refusing to let me break up with him a lot ha gone on in this relationship and it s been a nightmare and there s no real way to keep it brief after dating long distance for many month and realizing that i wasn t going to be able to continue my career in my home state and get paid a decent wage i decided to move 1000 mile north to live close to my boyfriend honestly the move itself ha been great i made two amazing friend who i would trust with my life got an amazing job that i could honestly see myself working at until retirement and they will pay for me to continue my education however my reason for moving ha turned out to be a controlling possessive manipulative and possibly violent asshole during the seven almost eight month that i ve lived here now he ha refused to let me go anywhere without him kept me isolated from almost anyone i could have ever met save for his two closest friend ha prevented u from attending any event party or even just dinner with his friend because a he ha recently explained to me he wa so worried i d find someone who is better than he is and just leave him basically i ve been a prisoner in my own home for the last seven month and a lot of that is my fault for having no backbone and just putting up with his behavior i wa struggling with depression for a lot of it and rather than just leave when i wa fed up i d convince myself that i wa clearly the problem harm myself often and just move forward pretending nothing wa wrong with his behavior about a month ago i took a trip home to visit friend and family before the trip bf had a huge anxiety attack and mental breakdown about me leaving him on this trip and not wanting to come back to him because of this the day leading up to my trip were full of stress and unhappiness but on my trip being finally free of him i realized just how unhappy i wa letting myself be decided i wa done being a prisoner and resolved to change my situation when i returned home now on top of being controlling and possessive bf really wasn t a good boyfriend we didn t talk anymore we never had sex he wasn t affectionate or loving in any way and honestly i m 99 sure that he just kept me around because i made more money and didn t have a problem paying for thing in our relationship when i returned from my trip i decided that there wa no fixing this by confronting him about his possessive behavior it wa just time to toss out the whole relationship i started going to therapy about two week after i got home my therapist agreed that his behavior wa not only just controlling but also abusive she advised me to leave him and wa happy to hear that i agreed the only issue we saw with me breaking up with them wa that i wa renting my home from his mother and so he had a key and while bf ha never been violent towards me his anger issue are pretty bad and i m a petite 5 0 110lbs girl who ha no way of defending myself so the threat wa still there we decided that i d just have to put up with his behavior a little longer until i could find a new place to live well le than a week later he threw a fit on our way home from dinner his friend who became aware of his treatment of me before even i did and tried to help invited both of u to a party in a few week and offered to drive me there since bf would be working until late that night i mentioned it to him and he went off on me about how i prioritized other people over him and how i wa simply a terrible girlfriend for even asking he asked if i even wanted to be with him anymore and exasperated i told him no cue an argument in my room once we got home where i finally admitted while sobbing that i d been miserable for the last seven month that when i d bring my concern and issue with the relationship to him he would never change his behavior and that he wasn t the person i thought he wa before i moved he acted extremely sad told me not to give up on him and that he would never give up on me and decided that he would stay over that night to comfort me a few day later i pressed the issue again and told him that i did not want to be with him he started to gather his thing to leave pretended to cry while hugging my dog telling her he would miss her and to take care of mommy before he turned around and demanded to know why i reiterated how unhappy i wa and that i could not see myself being happy with him he grew angry and told me that we d only argued a few day ago and he hadn t had the chance to change his behavior and make me happy after more arguing he threatened to ruin his life if i didn t give him a chance said he d quit his job lose his car his house etc if i would not say yes to him i told him that he wa being manipulative and he swore that it wa just him showing that he would sacrifice everything for me yeah because i d believe that i knew i needed to get away and he refused to leave or let me leave until i told him yes so unfortunately i did so that i could try to leave the house he took this a everything being okay again and decided that he wanted sex right then afraid of upsetting him or not being able to leave and get help i didn t tell him no and then i left my biggest regret right now is not going to the cop right after this happened i called one of my friend and asked if i could stay at his parent place with my dog that night and if he and our other friend would come help me get my thing since bf would still be in the house and would not let me leave if i tried when i got home that night my friend were parked down the street just in case i needed them or needed them to call the cop i confronted bf again told him that i wa done and that he needed to leave he pulled every line in the book at that point you re the only partner i ll ever have again no one else compare to you and you re the only girl i could see myself marrying or having kid with that kind of b he refused yet again to leave or let me leave until i gave him a chance he told me that he knew we were supposed to be together he sobbed about how his insecurity caused him to act like a different person one who wa controlling and possessive and told me that he d do better he tried to attribute his changed personality to his stress began claiming that he had bipolar disorder anything to take the blame off of his shitty behavior and treatment of me i told him firmly one more time that he needed to leave and that i needed space i told him that if he did not leave my friend would come in and make him leave so he did but rather than go home he stayed in his car and sat outside my house the entire night not wanting him to be reckless and fight my friend i told them that i would just use the latch on the door and that they should go home and get some rest a it wa about 1 am by then the next day i went out with a friend who wanted to help me relax and treated me to a pedicure i didn t think that bf would harm my dog a we d been continuing the argument via text that day and it seemed like he wa finally understanding that i needed space and time and wanted nothing to do with him when i got home later however there he wa standing in my living room looking proud of himself he d cleaned my entire house mopped vacuumed everything he sat down and proceeded to go on about how he d been a bad partner and that he wa going to try to make thing better and put actual work in he promised that he didn t see u a together right now and would give me my space but that he would show up every day a the person he should have been for month he told me he didn t care if it took month or even year for me to trust him again and want to be with him but that he would be here trying to show me the man he really is it s been two day now there hasn t been any space he text me constantly he go to my house to do thing for me and see my dog while i m at work he left me a scavenger hunt yesterday with gift hidden all over he invited me to his family s thanksgiving and asked if he could take me to that party we d fought about a week ago he begged me not to tell anyone that we aren t together anymore but i refused he hasn t told his mother about any of it so that she won t kick me out even though our state law say she d have to give me 30 day notice anyways i m working with my friend to find a place we can all move to together bf will not be informed of my address will not know that i live with them and will not be allowed over under any circumstance once i m removed from the situation i ll block him on all platform and just pray he doesn t show up at my work follow me home i m not filing for a restraining order until i move because a long a he ha access to my home a restraining order won t do much if he decides to harm me or my dog on a whim i know i should have gone to the police the first day he refused to let me leave i m terrible with confrontation and conflict and i didn t know if i wa making a bigger deal out of it than it really wa and i also know i would have felt guilty over possibly ruining his life over something that i could have been over dramatic about i need to grow a backbone and learn how to stand up for myself better but in the heat of the moment i just do whatever seems like the safest option for me i m hoping to have a lease signed by next friday and to be moving in that day i am very happy that i have made a few trustworthy friend here who want what s best for me and will do whatever they can to help but i just can t help but look back at this relationship in disbelief that i let myself be emotionally abused and controlled for so long,1
i still feel broken i f23 with my abusive partner from 17 to 22 y o it s been exactly a year and a half since we ve broken up our 4 year relation after that i wa for a year with my ex who wasn t abusive but had a huge emotional baggage and wa hard to follow so i ve truly been alone for the first time of my adulthood in the last six month i find it delightful to make my own decision to be free to have friend of my own and to respect myself in the other hand if i really stop and think about it i m still mad at myself for letting this happen for so long i also find it hard when i react to something in a way that i know is related to how i ve been treated in the past i want to evolve to be more than an abused woman and deep down i know i am way more than that but damn this is hard sometimes,1

how to leave i made a post last night about my boyfriend and his best friend and i ve decided to leave him but how do i even go about it i ve tried to leave so many time but he will literally sit down and say he s not leaving we live with my parent so i never get loud with him because if he start yelling at me my dad will go nut i just don t want the drama with my parent involved and when i pack up his stuff he started grabbing me and forcing me to sit down to talk it out which normally turn into him cry to the point where i feel bad and don t wanna leave anymore what do i do now how do i leave,1

because she ha been with him for a few year and had to she always complained about him stupid little thing that i didn t feel were worth complaining about and i d call her out on it and try to help her when my wife died she comforted me more than anyone else other than my kid did like i said she wa always a very good friend about a year and a half ago she called me upset because she had caught her husband with someone else apparently he had only married her because he wa expected to like i said they re both indian and didn t want to disappoint their respective family she filed for divorce and i wa there for her like she had been for me my kid are older teenager so childcare wa different than when they were younger i have some time to be able to reconnect with friend etc about a year ago my coworker and i began to hang out more often we d go hiking to movie to the beach etc more often than not we d just hang out at my house talking or watching a movie nothing ever happened a few month ago we were talking and i got incredibly quiet and sad she asked me what wa wrong i showed her a poem by rumi i choose to love you in silence she looked confused and asked if that wa how i felt about her i couldn t speak and just nodded my head yes she sat silently for a few minute then began to cry she started telling me she d been in love with me for year since a few month after we met but that she had kept it in because i wa married and she had a boyfriend she had no idea i d felt the same way i told her even if she had nothing would have happened and likely our friendship would have ended because i didn t want an affair we ended up talking for a few hour that night and eventually just decided that it had been too long and too painful and we should just give a relationship a shot we ve been together a few month now my kid and her get along quite well they ve asked me if we re going to get married and i told them we had talked about it and that in all likelihood we would be

dinner cruise and plan to propose to her on the cruise she know i plan on proposing but doesn t know when and think it s still a year away our coworkers have commented that we re the perfect couple and some of them thought that we should have gotten together year ago i m so happy i don t consider myself overly emotional but i ve caught myself tearing up a few time about how happy i am i ve found someone who i feel is my other half someone who instinctually know me and how i feel without me saying anything i m the same way in term of her i can instantly tell if something is bothering her my question is since we ve only been together a few month is it too soon to propose knowing her she wouldn t think it wa too soon i m not having any doubt about the relationship just about the timing of the proposal tl dr been together for about half a year have both had feeling for each other for the greater part of a decade but couldn t be together now we are is it too soon to propose,0

a self reflection on release this is a reflection i wrote to myself for myself of realization and acceptance although it is a personal message releasing it anonymously feel gratifying how do you release yourself from a vortex of whirling fear depression and anger which you built up over the weekend when you finally realized and accepted 6 month after leaving you were in an emotionally abusive relationship you write you liberate yourself through the act of transferring your thought and word onto a piece of paper you finally pop open that bottle of emotion and let yourself experience the idea of emancipation you watch the bubble containing guilt burst in the bottle you decant the denial the denial that you could not have possibly been in an emotionally abusive relationship with the person you loved and who you believed loved you indispensably you finally realize that the person you were so fond of and saw your future with did in fact emotionally abuse you how by controlling you guilting you starting to isolate you even giving you the silent treatment you ask yourself why you haven t realized those red flag sooner why you thought that the thing they were doing wa okay it turn out it wa because they were your first how could you have known that them giving you the toxic silent treatment is a red flag that click to most if not all people you couldn t you were ignorant you were in love you became attached of course you knew that no relationship wa of only fresh summer green grass but you thought that them ignoring you wa just part of that rough patch which every relationship ha that them ignoring you wa acceptable to what you unintentionally did to them they were your best friend your soulmate the one person you looked forward to talk to every night so the thought of leaving them wa unimaginable you thought you have finally found your other half your lifetime partner who you would stick by until death do you two part truth is you did find your other half your lifetime partner but only had them for a little while something happened that lead them to their death and reincarnate into someone who looked the exact same but treated you differently you were with someone you never knew and yet you still stayed in a relationship but not with the person you started it with although you still hurt cry even still blame yourself for not communicating and trying hard enough you at least become satisfied that you have finally realized and accepted what ha happened and why leaving 6 month ago wa the right decision thank you,1

my 30m girlfriend 30f is super suspicious and jealous of my best friend s overly friendly new girlfriend 29f it make hanging out super awkward and i m not sure how to handle this been with gf will call her allie for 2 year we live together and recently moved to another state for her job for some important context our relationship had a bit of a rocky start basically when we met i wa getting over a hangup crush on a mutual platonic friend who wa unavailable so allie wa initially a lot more into me than visa versa allie could sense i liked this friend but i denied it after i continued dating allie and my feeling grew i got over the friend but she eventually pressed me to admit she wa right about the crush and how i originally felt luke warm about her this obviously hurt her and thing kind of blew up we worked through it but the jealousy insecurity and trust issue from this never fully went away it been a wedge between u we ve been working on through the entire relationship i ve learned to avoid her trigger and it been mostly ok a of late a few month ago my best friend from childhood kevin told me he wa actually moving about an hour away from u allie and i haven t made a ton of new friend out here so this wa exciting about a month after he arrived he met a girl will call her jill who he s been dating since about a month ago i met up with kevin for a concert where he introduced me to jill for the first time allie unfortunately couldn t make it to the show jill and i got along really well i thought she wa super nice amp cool she even went up and did an awesome karaoke song dance at the bar afterwards kevin seemed to be on cloud 9 about her when i got home i told allie about the show and about jill kevin is a bit of a character so i jokingly mentioned i wa surprised he landed a catch like that and that i wa happy for him i also boasted about jill s karaoke performance i could immediately sense allie s suspicion radar went off she even made a snarky comment like oh she sound way cooler than me this wa a familiar routine i told her to stop being ridiculous and changed the subject later that week jill came up in conversation again and allie made another comment she also asked why i kept talking about her so much i again told her shes being ridiculous fast forward to 2 weekend ago kevin invited u on a camping trip with him and jill allie wa initially hesitant due to her already formed suspicion that i wa into jill or something we ended up going and the trip wa a lot of fun allie and jill seemed to get along well afterwards i asked allie what she thought of jill she gave a sort of half yea she wa nice i could tell she wasn t being honest after i pressed she finally admitted that she wa suspicious of her and thought it seemed like she wa into me i reassured her she wa imagining thing she said she just seemed overly friendly and wa laughing at all my joke and even kevin commented on how well we got along this sparked a bit of an argument i told her how much it suck she feel that way since kevin is a good friend and i want u to all be able to hang out together but allie just told me my suspicion were right when we first started dating and they re almost always right honestly in allie s defense i can sort of see why jill could have triggered these feeling she is very friendly bubbly outgoing and we also seemed to vibe very well together a friend almost immediately but it nothing more than that and i really don t think she like me in that way and even if she did it wouldn t matter since we re both taken but now i feel trapped with no way out of this kevin asked u to come out with them for his birthday allie agreed but i could tell she wa aprehensive and anxious about it i want to be excited to hang out with kevin whenever i also enjoy jill s company a a friend and want to be able to be comfortable friendly towards her but allie s suspicion amp anxiety about her make hanging out with them ridiculously awkward i feel like i ll always be walking on eggshell with her analyzing both of our every move but once allie s radar go off i have no idea how to pull her out of this i fear a long a jill is her usual friendly self allie will never warm up to her i don t know how i can remedy this tl dr girlfriend is jealous and suspicious of my best friend s girlfriend not sure how i can hang out all together now without it being awkward,0
it feel like quicksand it feel like quicksand i thrash and scream only to get sucked in further sand filling my lung until i am silenced again a hand outstretched i can breathe for a moment but now i m too tired to leave so i stay still merely surviving silently quietly completely still i cope by writing metaphorically a silly a it sound but it s been helping in short feel stuck in this emotionally abusive relationship i act out and make a scene when thing get bad only to go through self loathing and depression people try to help but i feel so weak scared and alone i am a shell of myself just needed to vent for anyone reading this you aren t alone,1
my crush 23f wish she wa a virgin because i am 28m and it bother her so my crush is pretty insecure about not being a virgin i am and plan on remaining one until i hopefully marry her one day we are both religious but i don t mind that she s had sex with other people in the past nearly everyone ha and i feel i d be a bit narcissistic to hold a girl to my choice of being a virgin i m an anomaly and i ve accepted that and i feel it would be unfair to hold someone else to such a standard plus the odds of finding a girl with the right personality look etc and also them being a virgin are so low i feel it s naive to screen my love interest primarily on that people make mistake and choice and learn and grow from them it s the choice they make afterward that define if they would be a good partner for me imo i m not sure what to say to her though at first i thought it bothered her because she thought i would think le of her i reassured her that i literally don t care at all this might have even been part of the case but she say that the problem is that being a virgin actually mean a lot to her and she isn t from what i ve been able to deduce she really want to share the moment of losing her virginity to me plus most people think she is a virgin even though she isn t and i guess it s kind of eating her up that i ll be able to have that moment with her but she won t be able to have that moment with me because she s already had sex in other relationship tldr she s not a virgin i am but i seriously don t care about it at all she s become insecure about it though what can i do or say to make her feel ok about her not being a virgin it doesn t really seem to be about me being a virgin but it seems to be about her not being a virgin and not being able to lose it to me sadly could this become a problem if we got married in the future,0

helped my 30m friend 30m move for 6 hour he took u to an expensive restaurant and hinted that we split the 130 bill i thought he wa treating u out brian just sold a business and made a decent chunk last week a friend tom and i spent 6 hour helping brian move out of his apartment at some point in the move brian mentioned we were going to grab dinner afterward which i assumed meant he wa treating u out brian recommended an upscale restaurant and suggested some item which sounded good to u all told the bill wa 130 he looked at it and showed u the receipt hinting that he wanted to split the bill i get the feeling that he wa going to treat u out but then saw the damage and skimped out we split the bill but to be honest if i had known that we were going to do that i would have suggested a cheaper place i assumed the common courtesy for helping friend move is treating them to some food drink so i found it a little weird that tom and i end up spending 50 each all told for the dinner tom and i did end up taking some of brian s stuff that he didn t want to move maybe that s why brian felt fine with that my question is how do i politely figure out if brian meant to treat u out beforehand i didn t want to put him on the spot when the bill came out and i didn t want to assume that he wa paying we re all from the same western culture so this wasn t a cultural misunderstanding tldr helped a friend move for 6 hour he took u to an upscale restaurant i assumed he wa treating u out but we ended up splitting a pretty hefty bill 50 each how do i ask if we re being treated before we end up with the bill,0
my 23 f 3 closest friend 23 f lie exclude and ignore me but expect secret santa gift so about three week ago my close friend and i let call her emily get in a small debate later that day when we usually meet up she is not there and when i ask what s up or if she s ok she say not now and say i can t deal with you and say she doesn t want to talk to me for the next two day she completely ignores me in person and outside we are around each other very frequently after an in person apology for making her feel invalid she never got back to me what wa wrong and for upsetting her and telling her that i really valued our friendship she snapped back angrily and continued to ignore me i understand that i needed to give her space but after about a week after nothing i would ask her if she wanted to talk and that i wanted to fix our relationship for me this wa completely out of the blue especially day before having helped each other out with university and i wa constantly trying the be the best friend i could be but again i apologized and get maybe my debating wa interpreted a a microagression so then after two week emily never get back to me and then start pretending everything is fine again which really hit me because i wa emotionally hurt after that happening suddenly the thing is emily and the other two woman in my friend group start excluding me talking with each other and not noticing me doing groupwork without me and then they went to see a show that i expressed heavy interest in after asking about it to another close friend ira she said it wa a personal thing but today admitted that they all went today wa supposed to be secret santa and i bought a pricey gift for another friend in our group let call her mary i ended up not going after i realized tonight that after no apology for being treated unfairly being lied to and excluded i emotionally couldn t so mary ira and emily all just asked where i wa and just kept asking for the gift that i got and said that this wa something we all agreed upon even though this wa before i wa being treated poorly by these friend no one even asked me directly if i wa going the catch is i ve known them for five year and really cared about our friendship and kept on reaching out to fix thing with no reply after realizing they cared more about doing secret santa than me a a person what should i do tldr friend lie exclude me ignore me arbitrarily and never talk to resolve anything after me reaching out but expect me to show up and bring a gift to secret santa should i keep the pricey gift i got for myself should i accept the gift from my person after being treated poorly and lied to by them should i let these friend go even if they have been the closest to me for year,0
update i 28f hate my boyfriend s 34m hobby so it ha been 9 month since i posted in link to the original i got some good advice which i mostly ignored but i thought it deserved an update anyway despite the fact that it got little attention the basis of my previous post wa that my boyfriend wa addicted to magic the gathering he constantly wanted me to come to tournament with him and watch him play even though i had no interest in the game and it wa boring to me our problem obviously ran deeper than that he ignored me to feed his addiction to video game including mtg arena and he lied to me about our sexual compatibility very early on in our relationship well i wish i could say i walked away shortly after that post i knew deep down i should have but i didn t we stayed together almost 14 month and not only did the situation not improve it got much worse when he lost his job in early june still though i loved him and i thought he loved me so i stayed and tried to remain patient with him after all he lost his job and that is an obvious stressor then he got into school an hour from our hometown shortly before our one year anniversary and it wa decided that we would move in together the following month once i found a job in the big city i did that a few week ago and i thought thing were on track exactly one week before i wa supposed to start he got emotionally distant which he expressed wa because of stress associated with a full time job and taking night class but he never communicated any problem with u last wednesday he snapped me on the way to work after ghosting me pretty much the whole day to let me know he wa rethinking our relationship we didn t get to have a conversation about it for almost an entire day we talked he said he needed more time to think and would let me know what he decided on friday then he called and broke up with me in a 10 second phone call 5 minute before work that same night like an idiot i still clung to the idea that i could fix thing and he allowed me to stay with him for 2 week while i looked for my own place in the city he moved to i got up there and realized i hated the city the job and i could not emotionally handle being around a man who explicitly told me spending time with me felt like an obligation and his video game were more important it just hit me in an inexplicable wave and i knew this man child wa never going to not be selfish or prioritize anyone over his want and need i spent the last year being the cool girlfriend who didn t rock the boat i put my need to the side in order to sustain a relationship that wa never going to work one comment from my op ha remained in my head since i last read it i know guy like this and their fundamental character attribute is selfishness he show it by monopolizing your time and he show it in the bedroom or while he s on his computer and you re in his bed alone this kind of just okay enough relationship is going to rot you from the inside out you ll slowly feel yourself dying inside a you try to suppress that persistent panicked realization that this isn t right and you deserve happiness but he can t give it to you get out now before you sink the next ten unhappy year of your life it pretty much hit the nail on the head i knew thing weren t right but i still tried and my effort failed it hurt like hell still because i do genuinely care for him but it s for the best i ve moved from the grief and denial stage into anger i m angry with him for being so damn selfish and being so bad at communication but i m mostly mad at myself for getting into a relationship with someone like him in the first place he say we should break up work on ourselves separately then try to find our way back to each other and i thought i wanted that but again he is literally never going to change i on the other hand am gonna go have some good sex for a change with a guy who doesn t treat it a an obligation i m gonna reconnect with my friend and use this learning experience to finally get my own physical and emotional problem under control i m not doing it for him but for myself i advise anyone who is dealing with a so who ha an addiction or incompatible libido to leave if you try to talk it out and nothing change you can t save them you can only save yourself don t be like me don t waste a year of your life on a selfish person who only care about their next fix be it drug alcohol gambling or a video game addiction you ll find yourself miserable and alone in your own relationship and you only have yourself to blame tl dr boyfriend wa addicted to mtg and video game he preferred them over me our libido were also mismatched we broke up and i m better for it,0
just found out my fiance sexted with her old high school crush so we ve been together 4 year and i ve never been happier we d always said that we were each other s best friend and shared everything even the most difficult and intimate detail we re both divorced from previous relationship and are managing a large blended family but we ve always been a team and supported each other through everything this summer her old high school crush hit her up on social medium and i remember her showing me even a she got the friend request she told me all about how she had felt about him 25 year ago but nothing came of it over the next week she told me often how he had almost immediately turned the new communication into constant request to have sex with her and how she wa disgusted by him and disappointed in how he d turned out after all the year she d said that she had been flattered at first at how he had been her first crush and she craved the validation that other men were turned on by her but i guess i wa naive in thinking it wa just that and nothing more she d been honest with me that she know that she ha self estime issue and seek validation that she is beautiful and more this validation often come from guy hitting on her a she is beautiful i wa very supportive of her working on dealing with this and we d even started seeing counseling to discus it fast forward to 4 month later and she ha told me many time that she s blocked him on social medium and wa feeling creeped out by his constant stocking he had even gone so far a to show up at her work and her having to call hr and security i d been feeling that she had been a bit distant and more troubled than usual so i just took a quick look at her photo and found a text she d sent him saying she didn t like the way she wa feeling thursday night and didn t want him to contact her any more i looked back and wa able to put together that it wa a thursday night that she had gone over to her best friend s for drink and hadn t come home until midnight i confronted her about this and she admitted that she had met him twice in the past month and had been feeling horrible about it and that s why she had been acting different they d met for lunch at work and it wa completely platonic though she knew he wanted more she said the thursday night comment wa about him texting her all evening while she wa with her friend s we booked an appointment with our counsellor and we had a long emotional discussion about how i felt betrayed she wa advised that to help u heal she needed to be completely honest she admitted that she had flirted with him those first few week in the summer including 3 softcore texting and one hot photo she s adamant that she never did more and felt horrible about it and that s why she wa struggling so much through the summer and especially the last few week a that s when she had met him for lunch to hopefully close the loop and get him out of her life in some way i believe her but i m hurting so much that she would have risked everything we ve built over our 4 year together over some guy she said wasn t even attractive and wa not the man she remembers from high school but part of me is also worried that her strong desire for more validation to sooth her anxiety and self esteem issue is just going to lead her into doing something like this again i don t know if this can be salvaged and if we can rebuild the trust again she s taken some time off work to be with me and she had an unrelated doctor s appointment today and even the doctor called me in to tell me that she understands just how hurt i must be but that she the doctor also know just how much my fiance love me and how much i mean to her this doctor ha known my fiance for almost 20 year through her old marriage and helping deliver her child so she wa making the point that she know how our relationship isn t like the one my fiance had with her ex husband am i being naive or is there hope with a lot of hard work and counseling tl dr fiancé ha validation issue and i just found out she d sexted her old high school crush can this be healed,0

i don t know if it wa abuse but i have been unable to fully function for 2 year at the time i started dating my ex we ll call him ted he had just turned 23 and i had just turned 28 we didn t discus age until later and by then our relationship wa moving very quickly we were both living with our parent for various reason so two month into dating he wanted u to move in together but also two month into dating he started to accuse me of cheating ted had been cheated on so i thought it wa fear and insecurity i tried many thing to convince him otherwise expressed how it hurt me and asked that he challenge himself to work on it ted once told me that because i had once been in an open relationship it wa hard to trust me also i once admitted to ted that when i first met him i wa attracted to him at the time i wa also in a new relationship that wasn t going well and i knew it wa going to end ted once told me that because i had found him desirable while i wa with another man he didn t trust me these were thing i obviously couldn t change so when i tried to end thing with him because i started to feel bad he told me i wa his soulmate etc we remained together the next time i wa accused of cheating it wa because of a rumor ted had heard from his friend that night we went out and i decided to go home i took his car key and gave him my bicycle in case he had one too many beer i wasn t too sure about his drinking habit he bicycled home scraped up my bike and his arm smashed his phone came in the house slamming door yelled at me drunk i bandaged him up and told him to lay down and sleep instead he grabbed his shoe and walked out it bothered me but i thought it wa a one off situation and wouldn t happen again if we could work on thing there were also small thing besides the accusation of cheating when i told him i wa going to bartend at our old bar for extra money he told me no it wa his place and his friend we once planned to dress up for the renaissance festival when he didn t but i said i wa still going to he told me i d make our other friend feel stupid for not having a costume once when we got into a fight he said he wa going to come over and talk to me i told him not to i wanted to be alone i set my phone down and got in the shower next thing i know the shower curtain is being ripped open and he is yelling at me and slamming his hand on the wall when i argued with him about a time when he wa drunk he told me he remembered everything he started to argue with me all the time about how i remembered thing so i started to text him more so there would be a record once i patronizingly told him he wa young and he wa upset with me for bringing up our age and experience difference he didn t like that i had a b s and he hadn t yet finished college fair but three year later when i asked why he did some of the shitty thing he did he said it wa because he wa young and full of bullshit the problem is that he wa also really wonderful and we had some awesome time but i wasn t able to trust him either i wa walking on eggshell having my first panic attack angered that he couldn t support me but wanted me to support him and i started to blame him for most of the problem in the relationship sometimes when we talked my body would seize up my brain would go foggy my tongue would get thick and my speech slowed by the end of the relationship he wa mad at me for implying he wa abusive he started to insinuate i wa crazy and i think he started to believe it i became very depressed when i tried to describe how i felt he told me it wa stupid and then we decided to take a break two month after not talking i asked if we could reassess our break he said he thought our break wa an actual break up and then proceeded to ghost me for a month until we ran into each other in a parking lot what follows after that is a sad year long fizzle to what i thought wa u working on thing and him using me until he felt ready to move on including a weird request by him to read the first chapter of a book so he could tell me i wa like the main character who couldn t let go of the past he ha now been happily supposedly we quit talking a year ago dating a new woman for over a year by the end of the relationship i felt crazy my entire reality felt false i missed him like mad i still miss him i haven t been able to get past whether or not he wa abusive or it wa just a bad coupling how can he be so happy now how can this woman not also be being abused if he wa an abuser wa it just me did i make him feel insecure am i that shitty i know i m not perfect and i had my moment in the relationship too i started off in love and then angry and then depressed and sad so of course i wasn t always my best but how can he have moved on and i fell to piece i had a traumatic dissociation even and saw a therapist some day i want to reach out to him and talk to him just to see if i made it all up and he s not that bad or see if he really is i also feel bad because because when i ve read account on the internet so people have such horrible abuse story and i don t think i can say i wa abused i wa often tricked and lied to and accused sure but not abused right,1

would i be the manipulative on i m in a bit of a pickle i have this fling and thing for the most part were going ok we d have fun together outside of his occasional asshole comment that are definitely covertly abusive and when confronted continues on in covert narcissistic tactic anyways we d only been dating for about 3 4 month and like many i m still learning i m starting to become more aware of situation i started noticing just how little the attention wa reciprocated in term of how much it wa sought by little i mean next to nothing and then faked if any effort wa put forth can clarify if so desired for the most part i brushed it off because whatever i knew i d never date this person because of the thing they ve said and their narcissistic tactic in dealing with conflict and communication we would chat maybe at most once a week to a far apart a 2 week break in contact cool i get to live my life he get to live his it s all good until recently when he started to increase contact to bi daily i ve been through this before it s amazing how narcissist can be so freaking textbook the text we re the look at me kind of text wanting attention but giving nothing back i put a stop to it after i realized the pattern by asking him to either reduce contact to the level it wa before or if he did want to continue communicating at the frequency we were he needed to reciprocate the attention by asking about me by allowing me to be the focus of attention i told him that frankly i needed him to do this anyways i didn t care if he wa genuinely interested or if he faked it but i needed it apparently he is in such opposition to doing this he s not even willing to attempt to fake even a modicum of interest in my existence outside what he can get from me shocking i guess i ve grown because i didn t realize just how absolutely disgusted i would be by him making that choice it is his choice however i m not going to try to talk to him about the issue again he doesn t want to he doesn t want to however i can t i just fucking can t hook up with someone so grossly callous towards my existence i can t sleep with someone anymore who doesn t see me a a human being i can t sleep with him i d be putting myself through something i d get absolutely no joy out of simply for their pleasure i feel incredibly guilty though and unintentionally manipulative because now i feel a if i have no choice but to break it off with him i gave him a choice he made it and now i m punishing him for it is how it feel on one hand on the other i feel like i m protecting myself against a situation and a person who frankly probably wouldn t piss on me if i wa on fire unless he thought it would help him get laid after i need advice am i being manipulative or wa i i m so confused recovering codependent with cptsd,1

my 28m wife 27f is acting weird im gone for 6 month and see her next week am i paranoid or are these sign of something worse tl dr we have been together almost 10 year im away for 6 month i think my wife ha been acting weird unsure if she is showing sign of infidelity of if im in my own head so i left home 3 month back this year ha been particularly bad for u she started a new job in a heavily male dominated trade which she talk a lot about the amount of infidelity that occurs there and that took her away for 3 month at the start of the year she wa home for a week then i left for a month of work up training to go overseas i had a month off prior to leaving but she primarily worked shift work for the duration so we have only really seen each other for 3 week this year i have a break coming up this weekend where we are going to meet up in europe for two week to have a vacation then i go back to work to finish off my time before going home so this all started a month ago or so she started making friend at work mainly dude which i supported wholly a i believe she need to build cameraderie she made several friend went on some camping trip with them dropped off the map a few time etc and i did my best to think nothing of it she would be pissed at me for doing the same if i ever got a chance to go out for a r amp r break a this is a pretty easy go where im working and for those i would sometimes not text her a much but again no big deal so after a stint of me working some crazy hour dealing with some mental shit regardning my best friend who offed himself the last christmas she got worried apparently she messaged me one night to apologize for going into my facebook i had been opening up about the suicide to my friend and some thought i still had on last conversation with our buddy a we were a tight group and i felt more comfortable sharing with them soldier are brother etc a well a a few year ago when i wa suicidal and confessed she just lost her shit at me so i figured it might not be best to bring it up to worry her or start a trigger she had gone in seen the message wa sorry she did it but pissed i didnt open up to her we fought it out i forgave her all good the week after started to throw individual weird event that have been off character for her we have been together for 10 year next month and have done a couple deployment etc but thing just seem odd she started drinking after work with her guy friend again something i supported to help her make friend a she is new to the job etc one night when she got off work though and i wa starting my day she randomly messaged me are you happy in our marriage taken aback and in the middle of work i responded with yes and we talked briefly before i assumed she went to sleep she messaged me several hour later saying she made it home safe from a night of drink an odd time to ask if our marriage wa alright before going out to party but again at the back of my head smaller piece have been adding up at the fore of my mind though over the last month she ha had zero interest in speaking about sex shes not huge on sexting but will indulge me usually once a week or so while im gone not now it pretty much shut down or topic changed any time i mention it she ha two gym buddy two guy from work she go with every day she cut and coloured her hair an ha gotten massively into fitness the lost weight look great but i wonder how much time she is putting into it with these guy she go on day trip with the same gym crew to a waterpark for a few hour which turn into all day shopping and dinner etc she is reluctant to send picture not nude but anything when she is with a group no snap story nothing again not a thing she ha done in the past if there is it never with anyone in the photo ie a picture of a beer she in conversation mentioned how people cheating with coworkers or on coworkers is bad in her mind but it their business and people shouldnt hold it against them a hard left turn from her previously held belief that infidelity is terrible hand down she randomly over explains her guy friend in vague detail after a night or an event the guilty thing i personally feel the worst about is after letting this stew for a couple week i tried to swap facebook profile on my laptop tonight she ha used my laptop i took with me overseas for facebook before and when i wa home it wa very common to open it up and have hers logged in instead of mine no big deal i didnt care or think anything of it in a moment of stupid paranoia i tried to swap profile to check her message and see if i could pull anything she ha remotely logged herself out from my laptop i know all of these seem petty and coincidental and ill probably see her in a week and it will all be fine i feel terrible for not trusting her i feel like garbage for having these thought but i dont have many guy here to run this past a im in a leadership position and dont feel overly comfortable exposing a degree of personal weakness that effectively amount to me just being paranoid if anyone could weigh in and either reassure me a an outside element or give me a picece of advice or input that may help me think im a little le crazy and something is or isnt happening i would really appreciate it cheer,0
is there a way to know if anyone is going to be abusive with you i recently 3 month or so broke with my gf we were like a year and a half together everyday with her wa just a session of shouting and blaming me for everything like being bisexual something that she took pretty bad when i told her well out of that the worst part wa that when she s furious with me about something she used to slap me or push me so i decided to finish my relationship with her and i definitely felt liberated i ve recently started bachillerato the grade that you must do to get to college here in spain i m 16 btw then i met a ton of new friend and specially a girl that get on with me a lot the shit part of this is that she ha pushed or either slapped me a bad a my ex gf did and that s something that i don t really tolerate on anyone what should i do i mean i know i m pretty like conspiranoic about it but i don t want to get through another of these never again,1
i think my dad is abusive and idk what to do after what ha happened today context i m 14 i ve been playing tennis for a couple year going about once a week i ve never played tennis seriously just for fun now that i m in high school a a freshman my parent really want me to join our tennis team it s a huge commitment and i haven t played tennis in more than 3 month so i suggested quitting tennis at first i talked to my mom i don t think i need to keep playing tennis and she just yelled at me that there wa no way that wa happening went to a friend s house and i get a call that i need to come back now to reconsider the tennis decision or i could come back in the morning and find all my priveliges gone after about an hour i came home and told my parent that i want an extremely constructive conversation no shouting parent have a history of absolutely losing their shit and all of that i started by talking to them about how long i ve played the sport and how i ve decided that it s not worth continuing since i suck anyway after a long amount of talking where i presented everything they just said heck no it s not even your decision haha that s stupid you don t get to decide that keep in mind these are south asian i m indian and my parent are too but we immigrated to america when i wa very young so after they just rejected me i tried to talk to them more and find a reason for them insisting and i wa basically pushed to the side while my parent actually discussed thing like the lesson they were gonna sign up for and who would drive me to practice at the school i don t want any of this i want a life i don t want to play tennis instead of homework and meeting my friend and then my dad just start getting really mad because he wa looking for a fight in the first place it s really easy to anger him and most of the time he will flip out at the smallest stuff i take ownership for getting frustrated and using sarcasm etc still he got super mad and just yelled at me for a good 5 minute about how i wa a failiure now i go upstairs to my room and try to sleep a it s 9 pm by now 5 m later he storm upstairs maybe he got bored and demand i leave to go sleep on the couch because having my own bed is a privelige i refuse because that s just dumb and he drag me out of the bed by my foot so now i ve realized that my dad will stop at nothing go downstairs and sleep on a couch he keep yelling shit at me and even come down to yell at my face but i never reply because he s honestly not worth angering further he slap me not hard at all and my hand went to my face so he slapped it away like twice i wa instigating him thru all of this and had a cheeky response to everything which i only stopped after he dragged me out of my room at this point he say that i ve disrespected him too much and that i don t count a a son and i can have my priveliges since now i ve really won and go to sleep in his room i m now in my bed with all my priveliges because he s asleep what the fuck do i do now he s going to try to ask for an apology in a couple of day so we can forget it and go back to loving father son but this is like the 4th time i ve considered taking very drastic measure due to his anger this is honest question without calling cps or the cop what do i do,1
trying to make a plan my relationship with my boyfriend ha been increasingly rocky it s now like we re not even together just co existing when he drink i make my mind up that we have to end it and he ha to leave but then when he s sober i convince myself i can t do it alone and it s really not that bad i own my own home and we have a daughter together i m trying to figure out the logistics of it all if i just break up with him or kick him out he will come back in his drunken stupor in the middle of the night trying to get in and if he doesn t i m constantly worrying that he is also he pay rent and half the bill i don t think i could afford anything if he moved out and that scare me more he s a good dad most the time and she really love him so that break my heart she s the reason i ve stayed with him longer i just don t know what s best for her and how to get away if that is what s best,1

how can i stop wanting constant revenge tw sexual abuse actual issue is mainly the last paragraph if you don t wanna read all this so i 18f wa with my ex 21m for the better part of a year it wasn t very long but it wa my first relationship and he wa the first person i d ever trusted that much it wa long distance but not much england ireland so we saw each other pretty much monthly in spite of having anxiety and asperger s i got on a plane for the first time a few month ago to visit him in person i did everything to make him happy he showed red flag from the start that i ignored a month after meeting he got mad at me for saying no to dick pic awkward virgin also i wa 17 and he wa 20 and it made me uncomfortable and made me feel so pressured that i ended up being sent them 4 day later anyway first time we met in person he took my virginity and i soon came to learn he wa extremely selfish in sex a couple day in he asked me to go down on him i wa too anxious to but he kept pressuring me to just try anyway even though i kept saying no then he got mad at me when i couldn t make myself do it and got all huffy got dressed again and ignored me while i cried again 17 and 20 he had experience while i wa new to everything happening and rather overwhelmed it also came out after i told everyone my story that at a new year s party only a week before he d tried to force himself on a very uncomfortable taken woman in front of his best friend and everyone while texting me how much he love me and can t wait to be with me the whole time later saying well that s the last woman before caitlin we counted ourselves a official then i still see it a attempted cheating he also cheated on his ex groped her when she wa really uncomfortable and didn t want it and tried to pressure her into sex with her parent asleep in the house the second time we met i told him i didn t want rough sex because all he ever wanted were position that were kinda uncomfortable for me lot of spanking choking face slapping etc and i didn t want it because i wanted to feel loved instead of a sex object but he told me it would just get rough anyway and did what he wanted to me i cried myself to sleep that night he wa the first person i trusted and i felt violated but i loved him and he said he loved me i just told myself it wa normal and what a good girlfriend doe other example include constant fight that were somehow always my fault him saying i literally gave him anxiety whenever i tried to bring up a problem i had with him he d start complaining about heart palpitation or saying he wa having a panic attack getting upset when i brought up a problem with him and going on about how he s a shit person so i d have to comfort him talking about how bad my depression made him feel if i ever tried to talk about it the time he slapped me for not wanting to do what he wanted to do during sex etc i wa blinded by loving him and i think to a degree codependency although thanks to working through that with my therapist i got past most of that and when he left me i felt confident enough standing on my own i didn t even realise i wa abused until the night he left me an i spoke to my friend and my new friend his ex girlfriend til 5am they opened my eye to how awful he wa and one friend who s the ex girlfriend of one of his now ex closest friend we ll call him j sent that friend screenshots of everything i told her which would come in useful later i last saw him on this day 2 week ago i told him everything he wa doing that wa upsetting me after talking to my therapist i d suggested he get one because he wouldn t and he went off on me started threatening to leave me telling me he shouldn t need therapy for a short relationship and that i wa the one needing it all the pressure to fix the relationship fell on me because i wa apparently the problem i came out with everything that wa upsetting me and eventually he relented and apologised for everything and promised to get better i d already booked to see him that weekend and wa excited to go and he said he wa too i didn t know he wa slagging me on his private twitter that he never even told me about saying i wa jealous of his friend and neurotypicalness and saying how hard it all wa for him he wa making himself the victim again all while telling me how sorry he wa that weekend wa amazing though he did genuinely seem to be sorry it wa the most loved i d felt the whole relationship and by the time i left i had so much hope it wa like that spark wa reignited again he broke up with me 4 day later seemed to decide i wasn t worth the effort at first he threw himself a huge pity party went on about how shit he is but then he just started going on about how he wasn t happy and how i give him heart palpitation all the time at first i wa angry then depressed but after a lot of cry and talking to my friend and his ex untill early the next morning i mostly stopped caring at first we were gonna keep in touch he kept saying he wa sorry and that he realised how bad he d been by this point two of his friend inc j knew and were thinking of how to tell their big group chat of friend some of whom he d known 7 8 year if he didn t say anything himself he finally went into the venting channel of their server to tell his story man i got so angry i had a huge panic attack at work and collapsed because i lost all feeling in my leg his friend sent me screenshots a he told his story about how i alluded to having mental illness which i didn t i told him straight up and told him i understand if it s a deal breaker how i wa constantly stressing him out with it but he continued because of love how he hit me on the hip lightly once after sex went bad oh yeah not cuz you didn t get your way and went on about how guilty he felt to downplay it he missed out all the really sickening shit made himself the victim and acted like i deserved all of it because of my mental illness he hadn t learned anything some of his friend sent their sympathy his oldest and closest friend wa dming him telling him to get help but still taking his side somewhat although some most who had been abused before sadly saw through his clever wording and sympathy begging and reached out to me instead i came out with everything the minute i got home a 60 tweet long thread only saying half the shit he d put me through with screenshots and everything j had also sent screenshots calling him out on his bullshit and left their server right after sending them after my thread came out he lost his main group of friend they remade that group chat without him it shook them so much a it would he d been fooling them a well a he had me making me think he wa the perfect boyfriend and that i wa the issue no one had suspected that any of this wa happening he d already lost his aforementioned best friend because he treated him like shit too his blaming my mental health excuse fell apart a his ex also came out about some of the shit he put her through she s neurotypical too his dad threatened to fly over to my house because i wa telling people which wa scary the whole family himself included still don t seem to think he s in the wrong he communicated with me entirely til email at the end while i wa getting my possession back from him he spoke way too formally but he used incorrect vocabulary and sounded like a stupid prick and acted a if he hadn t told me he loved me for nearly a fucking year he threw a hissy fit and told me he doesn t want anything from me and gave me every present i d given him over the course of the relationship including birthday present back to me he left them in a god damn travel locker for my visit to ireland that weekend and configured any future email of mine to automatically delete he wa being incredibly petty and shitty the whole time he s gone now though saturday wa the first time we hadn t spoke all day since november 25th thing is i find myself craving his suffering he already lost all his close friend but he messaged me about how happy he is now he isn t with me and how being with me just stressed him and talked about smoking weed with his friend and when i asked oh you still have friend lol a a joke he wa like i showed him the twitter thread and everything he still took his side somehow he s always on reddit too all the geeky sub i remember he pop up occasionally somehow i want him to never feel happiness again everyone say how i wa too good to him because i did so much and spent so much trying to make him happy and have good experience and shit i want him to realise how much he lost not have friend not just live without very many repercussion i find myself wishing i could stop getting that dream job at google or making all his college friend who seem to have taken his side and writing me off a the crazy jealous ex in spite of seeing my twitter thread outing him hate him and i don t know what to do about my insatiable want for some kinda revenge what can i do about this thanks if you read the whole thing ik it got really long,1

because i drove him to the store and he bought another box of wine and i just couldn t take it i tried talking to him about it which escalated to him being super defensive and to me yelling at him he then started yelling horrible thing at me mainly about how shitty i am and ended up hitting the trash can outside my mom s house so hard that it bloodied his hand then he kept threatening to leave and wa yelling at me inside mom s house a she s laying on her bed dying i holed up in her room with her that night and called my husband to come up there because i wa scared our mom ended up dying the next day since her death he s been staying in her home we haven t talked about the fight we had and he s been playing nice he s also stayed with my husband and i a few time because he found a therapist and a medical provider due to some health issue he ha in the city we live in it s a bigger area with better option than where my mom is from he s had moment of seeming that he genuinely want to change but he still won t acknowledge that he ha an addiction problem we re about to get into a huge battle about money he agreed to have me be the administrator of her estate but we didn t have access to her fund for about a month after she died i paid for all the bill in her house the first month then the estate money kicked in we have to keep the estate open four month so we re really not supposed to take any money out for ourselves yet until we see what s left over but i agreed to give him some basically it s gotten to the point where he s taken well over his share of what his half is expected to be after we pay all of her bill and he s spent the majority of it on alcohol oh yeah and a laptop so two day ago he wa begging me for 20 i told him i d send him 20 but that he wasn t getting any more after that from the estate now he s pissed and won t speak to me he also know that i m only paying the bill from the estate through this month then everything is getting cut off we have to sell her home too and i m just hoping he leaf after there s no internet access so we can start preparing it to sell he s the only surviving member of my immediate family and i feel like i m getting ready to be in an all out war with him what make it worse is that on her death bed my mom told me to take care of him but to be fair my therapist said that we really should define what taking care of him mean cause it s not the enabling that s been going on for so long how do i prepare for the impending explosion while trying to keep our relationship intact he s been ghosting me for two day now he know i hate when he doe that because of all the loss we ve experienced the last time he did it to me and my mom i filed a missing person report on him because he wa homeless and we had bought him a bus ticket to come home then he missed it i wa literally scared that he had died i expect that he ll eventually reach out when he need money and either throw on the charm or start saying terrible thing to me to try to manipulate me into giving him more money or he might just find a way to move to a new city without telling me i m terrified of what might happen and really don t want our relationship to be ruined but i honestly think he doesn t give a fuck even though he s good at making me believe he doe when i give in to him ha anyone been through something similar i have no idea what i m getting myself into and am scared of what might happen since my parent never held any real boundary with him tl dr my brother keep trying to get money out of me now that my mom died ha no job is staying in her home and struggle with addiction i cut him off and shit s about to hit the fan,0
why am i still doing this ,1
a message i will never send hey guy this is my first post that s not a comment here just for a bit of background i m currently 25 i wa in this relationship from 17 23 and i wa stagnant for the longest time trying to save a relationship that in hindsight should have been cut off from the first time i wa manhandled during our second year together with this ex i experienced emotional physical and mental abuse cheating gaslighting you name it a lot of the physical abuse would primarily be about my appearance because he wa grossly underweight for his height 6 1 and 120 lb and i wa at a healthy weight for my height and i m curvy so of course i m gonna look a little chunky it got to the point where he wa controlling what i ate monitored that i actually went to the gym vía find my friend threatened to hit up ex if i gained so much a a pound daily weigh in etc it wa hell especially when we lived together i learned much later from his sister s mouth that he had told her once that he wished i looked like a mix of her his sister and a thin ex that i knew about if that isn t fucked up idk what is i ve repressed a lot of what happened and i don t want to make this post longer than it already is but i wanted to share this because it made me feel better after marinating in my feeling after i finally left two year ago a message i will never send i don t even want to speak to you but i know that writing stuff out make me feel better it took me six long year to finally see what those who truly cared about me saw did it make you feel like more of a man to almost murder me twice did it please you to see me cry so hard while you laughed and had the ball to show your stupid as grin to my concerned parent did it make you feel better about yourself to smack me around and throw me constant curveballs in the form of fucking around with other girl just because you felt you could i know you only kept me around so you could feel a sense of control and not be alone because you can t truly ever be alone my only sin wa being kind and loving to you i don t know what kind of insane world you re living in i should ve listened to your father when he told me that i shouldn t date you but i did because i thought i saw something in you but you re just scum i m glad your new baby daughter s mother left you and found someone worth her time and to be a good father to your child you were never fit to be a parent and frankly i hope you die alone for what you did i hope that wherever it is bad people go you suffer and know the pain i went through but there s a bright side i m done being your victim it s taken two year but i have finally learned how to navigate this world a a survivor of domestic abuse i m still learning how to trust again and it hasn t been easy thankfully i have a small circle of friend who are always there when i need them especially my best friend and i have my family who quite literally saved my life from you so fuck you,1
i thought i hated the abuse but it s hell now that it stopped well you know how the story begin met a guy fell for him hard i don t remember if there were red flag initially but he started being physically abusive from the first time we had sex and he kept escalating from here one day i realized he wa emotionally abusive too to the point i started to change who i am for him he had torn down my self confidence made me be a lesser version of me so i broke up with him i wasn t happier for it i lasted about a month until i begged him to take me back he ha already moved on but he won t let me do the same i spam him with message and request to see him and every once in a while he ll respond the few time we ve seen each other it felt like nothing changed and thing are going to finally go back to normal but they never do anymore he just keep ghosting me it s just the right amount to keep me thinking i have a chance while i agonize over not getting to see him or talk to him the thing is i tried to move on but in a weird way i came to like the abuse i don t like the pain but it s become what i seek out in other men too i don t understand why that is i don t really want a normal relationship i found that boring even with him it feel like i ll never be able to find a fulfilling relationship now,1
i m 30m starving for affection from my wife 33f of 6 year and finding the prospect of cheating on her very difficult to resist a with most great relationship in the beginning my wife and i had lot of sex thing tapered down once we were married and settled into a routine and then took another dive after our daughter 2 y o wa born i m relatively insatiable sexually so this ha proven challenging but i ve always strongly valued monogamy and with a little helping hand have found the le frequent sex manageable however in the last year or two my wife seems to have stopped desiring me i m confident in my look and keep in great shape i m very successful financially and tirelessly supportive of my wife s own career i am very assertive but not in a dominating way with her unless she s in the mood for that and despite a very demanding work life make ample time to spend with her and our daughter often giving my wife well needed and deserved break i hear her girlfriend praise how great i am with their kid a well a our own and heard one whispering to another how sexy i looked one evening i put my wife first in literally every sexual encounter and bring her to at least one oral orgasm before stimulating 4 inter vaginal orgasm when we have sex i m not saying this to brag or claim that i m without fault but to emphasize that i m tending to our relationship more deeply than i ve seen in any male example remotely near to u we have had at least ten conversation over the last year or so about how i feel undesired she say she s just not often in the mood anymore she s maybe gone down on me twice in the last year and initiate sex once a month or two and only when she s in a very good mood and ovulating when she doe i feel betrayed that she ha to have all of the chemical rushing into her head to desire me and often ruminate on the sex sadly for that reason later i m starting to daydream about how i could cheat on her how it would feel to be desired again i m starting to allow myself to flirt a little more with woman and not to mention my wife a early on in conversation when i have a few drink after a business dinner i m incredibly tempted to take off the ring and introduce myself to someone it feel awful but the thought of making love to someone who want me again are becoming overwhelmingly prevalent and i don t feel capable of stopping them anymore i m not sure what advice i m looking for exactly we sae a couple of therapist 2 3 year back i wa having a problem drinking too much which i ve completely resolved lack of sex to a much lesser degree at the time came up in these session and my wife would look remorseful but frequency and or desire never increased i ve been candid with her about how it make me feel and how much i desire her she occasionally get down on her post baby body but i legitimately think it look fantastic and make that abundantly clear to her regularly i really don t know what else i can do but i love her and our daughter and don t want to divorce i just need to be desired and have sex again tl dr i feel like i m doing everything right and that most woman around me except my wife seem to agree yet my wife never want sex and the thought of cheating on her are very difficult to quell,0

my 26m wife 24f went off birth control le than 2 week ago and i feel like she intentionally misled me to think that there s a very low chance for her to get pregnant even though she wa ovulating she refuse to take a plan b and i m not ready to be a father my wife ha been on birth control for the last 4 5 year and 2 week ago stopped taking it with my permission because it wa impacting her libido and both of u also thought that her getting pregnant within the next couple month would be a good idea we have some unprotected sex for 3 day when she should have been taking her bc from her new pack but then have a very important discussion about the timing on the baby and both of u agree that now is an awful time for u to have one we agree to put all plan about the baby on hold for at least a few month while we figure out our life 5 day after she went off bc she tell me that she refuse to wear condom because of how she hate the smell and they irritate her and being super horny and wanting to have sex with her i ask her if there s a decent chance for her to get pregnant if we do have unprotected sex she tell me because she s not ovulating yet because she just went off bc we don t know about our fertility and because i ve been smoking a decent amount of weed there s only a tiny chance for her to get pregnant so we fuck and we also fuck the next day and the day after and she tell me the same thing there s only a tiny chance for her to get pregnant but now she s telling me that there s like 30 chance that she could get pregnant because we fucked during her peak fertility she tell me that she wasn t lying about her chance of getting pregnant because there s a higher chance that she won t get pregnant compared to actually getting pregnant but she knew that we were having unprotected sex during her peak fertility and she conveniently didn t let me know that of all the day of the month that wa the most likely time for her to get pregnant she wa ovulating either the next day we fucked or even that same day knew this wa the case and yet told me that there s a tiny chance that she could get pregnant after she told me that there s actually a pretty good chance for her to get pregnant now i told her that she need to take plan b but she refuse to do so she doesn t see any issue with her behavior because i knew that there wa some kind of risk of knocking her up by having sex with her she doesn t think she lied to me or misled me but this wa a miscommunication but the way how i see it i wa misled about the actual chance of her getting pregnant and tell me that it s my own fault for having sex with her and not knowing the female anatomy well enough to understand that it wa the riskiest time to have sex what am i supposed to do here our relationship ha a decent chance of not working out and we actually agreed to separate a couple week ago but then changed our mind and wanted to make thing work she refuse to take plan b because she doesn t think that she ll actually get pregnant but also want to keep the baby if she is pregnant would it be unreasonable to tell her that i will leave her if she doesn t take plan b because our relationship clearly isn t healthy tl dr wife went off bc we fucked a bunch and it wa the best sex of our life decided that we can t have a baby and stopped having sex for a couple day we both get horny i ask her if there s a high likelihood of her getting pregnant and she tell me there s only a tiny chance turn out that it wa her peak fertility which she knew and she misled me now we don t know if she s pregnant,0
my 28f boyfriend 32m ha this one christmas tradition i disagree with we have been nearly 2 year but this is our first christmas together we moved in together recently but last year we were worried it wa too soon to do a blended family christmas we both have kid from previous relationship my son jake is 9 and my boyfriend ha a son mikey 8 and a daughter rosie 10 yesterday my boyfriend called the kid into the living room and pulled out 3 small artificial tree each about 2 ft tall and gave one to each child and a large box of decoration to share he told me this wa a tradition for his kid because they could never agree on how to decorate one large tree so they each got one small tree to decorate instead i wa very touched that he included jake in this because i wasn t expecting it boyfriend say he d supervise the kid decorating so i get started on dinner after dinner i notice that the nesting table in the front room have moved we have 3 identical table but one is tallest then there s a middle one then there s the shortest one they were moved up against the wall in height order while normally there s one by each chair today i picked up the kid from school got home and the kid went into the living room 20ish minute later rosie asks me what i think of her tree followed by jake then mikey i tell all 3 kid that their tree look amazing they ask which one is best i say i can t choose because they re all great in their own way boyfriend get home kid ask him which tree is best he immediately say jake no hesitation he then put jake s tree on the tallest table rosie s on the middle table and mikey s on the shortest table mikey then object that his is better than rosie s and that s when it click that he s ranked the tree then he give jake a bag of chocolate coin rosie a chocolate penguin about half the size of jake s and mikey get nothing i have mixed feeling on this i don t want the kid to think they re in competition with each other and this just seems so ridiculous to me because it s actually created some friction a the kid are still arguing about whose tree wa best however i ve not spoken to my boyfriend about this yet because i feel like i m making too much out of this it s just a competition and he say they ve done it every year for about 4 year now and i don t want to disrupt that however that doesn t change that it just doesn t sit right with me i m not saying i want the kid to get participation trophy for everything but i don t think this competition wa strictly necessary and i m not sure introducing competition wa the best thing for the kid given the change in dynamic of u living together in short what i m asking is am i overreacting or is it no big deal and i should just let them get on with it amp x200b tl dr boyfriend had the kid decorate individual tree without telling me they were competing and i m concerned about generating unnecessary competition between them do i say something,0

how do i 40m communicate tactfully but firmly to my child s mother 39f that i don t want to engage with her the title make me sound horrible so i ll try to explain i wa in a relationship with my child s mother many year ago when we were both regular heavy drug user i lost contact with her when i decided to get clean and left the state to go to rehab for ten year i never spoke to her or engaged with her in any way and she never made contact with me either i didn t even know our shared child existed until recently so i ve been clean for ten year now she s continued off and on to use drug most recently when i got custody of our shared child she wa arrested on drug related charge with our child present she our child would have gone to foster care if i hadn t taken custody of her and of course i did even though that wa the first time i even knew i had a child she wa bonded out and is waiting for her trial and ever since she got out she ha been contacting me almost daily i have no interest in talking to her about anything but our shared child and she s not calling me or texting me to talk about her or even to her she say she want to be friend and didn t have a way to contact me before which is technically true although realistically for the sake of our kid she definitely could ve put a little extra effort in there i can t help but feeling that now that she ha my contact information she s going to continue to use it to her advantage even though i m not in any way planning to get dragged back down into that hole i ve tried to tell her that if she want to talk to our daughter she can and i ve tried ignoring her and i ve tried telling her i just don t want to go down this path with her but i feel like there s got to be some kind of firm tactful way i can tell her that i dont want to have any kind of relationship with her that i m just not thinking of doe anyone have any advice i just feel like if i get tied up in this shit in any way that isn t just raising this kid it s going to go down badly but i can t seem to get that across to her and i don t want to be hurtful tl dr ever since i wa inadvertently reconnected with my child s mother who is a drug addict that i had a relationship with when i too wa a drug addict she won t leave me alone how do i get it across that i don t want anything to do with her without being mean or hurtful,0
my 21f boyfriend 27m is abusive and i have no clue where to turn i suffer from bi polar and bpd my whole life i felt like this raving lunatic i ve felt like i m not worthy of anything or anyone good in high school i would sleep around and i so desperately wanted to be loved but i wa crazy and no one dated crazy you just fuck crazy when i wa 17 and still a senior in high school i met my boyfriend he came up to me at a party and immediately asked how old i wa i wa honest and told him 17 after that he wa basically latched onto me he wa older 23 at the time and i thought it wa so amazing this older guy wa into me i convinced myself that younger boy were the problem and i need a real man to be able to handle me i fell so in love and the day i turned 18 wa the day i ran out of my parent house to live with him he had convinced me to shut them out and that they didn t understand or care about me he drilled it into my mind day after day they were awful and abusive and hated me when now i m realizing none of that is true at all him and his roommate would constantly encouraged me to drank and do drug with them almost every night and every night would always end with my bf in a drunken rage screaming inch from my face that i didn t love him and i wasn t really there for him and i wanted him to just die he would blame me for never having any money and tell me he spent every dollar on me being happy i d offer to get a job and he would scream at me that his woman doesn t work the next day he would apologize and bring me something nice like flower or some stupid shit it wa so fucking cliche but i actually fell for that i use to convince myself he didn t hit me he didn t put his hand on me so why wa i complaining i m the fucking crazy one i deserve this he care and he took care of me i can let him scream at me finally after about a year and a half he got a promotion and he wa able to afford a 1 bedroom apartment for just u the day we moved out of his roommate place wa a real fucking turning point the first night he pinned me down and screamed in my face that i wa worthless and crazy and how wa he supposed to put up with my shit now without his friend i cried and cried and he got even angrier saying i wa trying to manipulate him the next day he didn t apologize he didn t get me any gift he didn t say anything he absolutely ignored me any time i spoke he wouldn t acknowledge me and pretended if i didn t exist this would go on for day until i would go absolutely insane i had no family or friend anymore and he wa the only one i could turn to or talk to every time i would break screaming and cry and starting to pull my hair out he would swoop back in and tell me he forgave me and he loved me again we would have a few good day after that i think the longest wa a whole month before he would pin me again and threaten to kill me and tell me i wa just another crazy bitch in this world but last week wa really what pushed me over the edge last week wa really what made me see everything for some reason he wa ignoring me it had only been about 4 day of being ignored and i wa coping with it ok i had convinced myself he would come back eventually and i could make it through this i think he realized i wa doing some what ok with the ignoring and he came in from work and he just handed me a knife he told me i should just consider killing myself already because he doesn t know how much longer he can take this i went to the bathroom with it and just stood there i held it for a long time and cried i kept having to convince myself i didn t deserve to die i finally told myself that this wa wrong i thought about how my friend and family never treated me like this that i wa happy with them that if someone love you this isn t how they should treat you all week long i ve been trying to convince myself this isn t normal behavior and i need to get out i m struggling so bad to really see my worth but i m trying i m trying to see he doesn t love me i have no clue where to turn he made me move to another state im scared to try and even contact my family i don t have any money we live in a small town and i don t know about any recourse i really have no clue how to get out,1
a new rule and a new tool atomiks reddit user analyzer plus i go on a rant again super long and full of entertaining link you should read this anyone that post in the manosphere set of subreddits is subject to a permanent ban effective on every post timestamped after this one i ve been trying to be open to what is going on behind the scene in this sub mostly troll shitposters lot and lot of red pill agenda pusher even a few stalker that are very persistent hi guy do you have a new account for me to add to the ban list i ve spend a lot of time lately reading this sub and feeling a bit helpless it seemed for every troll i banhammer down two more are popping up this is somewhat due to active troll posting to sub like mgtow when i ban them for disgusting comment mostly these whine about how evil i am or how much i am power tripping to ban them for no reason and how dare i attempt to protect these evil lying woman from these poor innocent menz and yes someone really said that to me except there is a very good reason first let me introduce you to atomix someone recently sent me a message that included the above link this is me i know exactly what is say if you care to read it you will see i have frequented a sub called purplepilldebate this sub ha went drastically downhill in the beginning it wa far nicer and now due to mostly rp mod is ha become yet another echobox of woman bad whiny little wanna be abuser that think woman are either virgin or prostitute and sometimes both if you are confused and don t understand what i am talking about then i really hope you never find out if you wish to know please allow contrapoints to explain this to you with her video on incels video recognizing facists if flamboyant trans dripping in sarcasm isn t your thing this one is a more factual bare bone explanation and if you need more convincing that this movement is a conspiracy let john oliver breakdown our culture of sexual harrassment this ha got a lot to do with my own escape from abuse my user account wa made only a few short month before i left so in a way i wa sort of reborn through my discovery of reddit and the absolutely incredible support i got to leave and stay out reddit wa there for me when i had no one else reddit ha been here through my entire life since then it a rare week that go by that i haven t been on one sub or the other a part of my personal recovery i couldn t afford therapy reddit ha been the best possible substitute therapist so many of the community on here are extremely caring so many user have posted brilliant comment that gave me insight and helped me to understand the many way my abuser manipulated and controlled me i wouldn t be who i am today without the incredible people i have interacted with on this platform the red pill sub wa started in the same year i made this account through the year i have argued with them time and time again some of their belief are quite disgusting i educated myself very thoroughly on what they advocate because they made me angry over time i have come to realize it because these are literally abuser educating others to be abusive they preach manipulation and the subjugation of woman they deny the reality of rape and actively advocate rape and sexual assault these are literally the asshole we victim have left behind just so you fully understand that for at least seven year i have watched this cult and yes it is literally a cult in specific a type called common enemy identity politics this agenda is no longer allowed here those involved with it will be banned if i find them on this sub if i feel a comment is pushing the what about the men agenda i will ban that user at my own discretion men are welcome to post about their own abuse here but should understand that if they comment on others post and derail by playing the but what about the men card then i will see them a belonging to the toxic bullshit and probably ban them i used that awesome little atomix to check quite a few of the user here several stood out for commenting mostly on porn sub anti woman sub dating sub and here that mix is questionable to me i am quite sure i don t want that type of person in a sub for giving advice and support to woman reeling from abuse i have received assurance that the reddit admins are a okay with banning people wholesale because hate sub user and that is likely happening down the road so the lovely tear you troll shed won t do you any good you can also save your threat of doxxing or posting on other platform i really really could give a fuck le i am done being afraid of talking i am done being quiet about how much some men hate woman i am done letting these abuser weasel their way in with but woman abuse too every time a woman speaks about her male abuser i am done letting these abusive people think they are being successful in taking over this sub so dear redditor that is just here for the support i suggest before you attempt to give someone sympathy for their but what about men that you pop their username into atomix and see for yourself if this is a person that deserves it new account will be subject to my own discretion i think i have seen enough to tell when they are pushing an agenda i have seven long year to get familiar goodnight all drop a comment below if you want this thread is anything go,1
my ex 30 gay say he in an abusive relationship is it true tldr my ex say he is in an abusive relationship but now say he didn t mean that and wa just upset he ha borderline personality disorder and probably other issue so this could be exaggerated drama my gut say he is trying to make drama but i don t want to ignore this what happened i received this message i ve been in an abusive relationship he had just broken up with his boyfriend i asked for clarification nothing i asked for a phone call he called and said i m not in a mood to talk about it i ll call you tomorrow now 36 hour later they are back together i messaged me you re back in an abusive relationship him yes m are you ok h yes m i don t believe you call me 20 minute later h i m really fine and safe lol no worry he s not really abusive m then call me and and convince me h i m with him now and i m busy m so you will call later h no additional information we were together for 2 year and we broke up 8 month ago we ve barely stayed in touch over messenger but anytime i ask him to call he say he cannot because his boyfriend get very jealous this is the first time he had been able to call me for a brief minute when he wa broken up is this a clue that he s actually abusive he may also just be a coward to talk to me because he never called once to break up with me either i also posted this in a borderline personality forum but i want to ask here this all started when he hooked up with this bartender in a live sex party in romania when they first got together he commented how his new boyfriend can get him to do anything in their first week he started eating meat doing drug regularly group sex moved in with this guy and relocated his business to romania his issue make this confusing and i don t know what to do,1
hey so i keep on thinking about my relationship and my ex slowly became very verbally abusive she would put me down constantly prior to the relationship i think i wa confident but she really showed me all my flaw from how i look to how i held a pen all the awkward stuff i do almost everything there is some truth to it i don t look amazing i guess i didn t dress well it wa good enough and i don t know about fashion i am a little awkward and weird but this ha completely destroyed my confidence and a year after she left i try not to get close with anyone because i know or feel that i m not good enough and they ll just eventually leave me anyway for it how do you undo this i don t want to be arrogant but i want to at least feel comfortable and not ashamed of my self constantly sometimes i think it s because i m such a bad person i gave her so many thing to pick on me about i also could leave her cause we got along so well and i wa in love when i d tell her she d say thing like well you just laugh it off when i try to leave she d tell my i can t take a joke i didn t know how to react until it got so bad i became depressed it killed my sex drive then she left me because of that i m having trouble understanding if i wa just weak to have that stuff get to me or just really didn t know how to react in a proper way or it wa her fault and she is the bad person for constantly making fun of me then telling me she love me when i tried to leave this wa my first real relationship it wa for 4 year and idk what a healthy one look like or how i should act in one,1
ex s emotional abuse killing my current relationship my ex and i were together for about a year during that time i missed so many little thing that i didn t realize until almost a month ago were probably emotional abuse i went from feeling like i could be myself with him to not even feeling like i could talk about thing that excited me he made so many comment that insulted my academic achievement my body and my interest even after we broke up it took almost two year to finally cut him out of my life for good my current boyfriend and i are at the stage where we are talking seriously about marriage and starting a family we agreed to wait until we re living together to actively try for a baby a few week ago we had a few day where we thought i might be pregnant when i got my period we were both relieved but also upset i ve told my boyfriend everything that happened with my ex and he ha been nothing but supportive but with the pregnancy scare it brought up some more painful memory my ex telling me my body wasn t built for having child combined with irregular period it really hit me hard since my period ended i ve been ridiculously upset that i wasn t pregnant it brings back those feeling that i m not worth anything outside of sex that s a whole separate issue i had with my ex and part of why it took another two year to get him out of my life i know my boyfriend love me deeply and is serious when he talk about a future with me but he can tell i m struggling and upset and it hurt because he doesn t know how to help and i don t know either i don t know how to let go of the hurt after so long three year of my life were wasted on being put down by my ex and he s still affecting my current relationship i m scared of losing my boyfriend if i can t get my emotion under control,1

i got weird message from my boyfriend 21m it turn out it wa him and his friend laughing at me 22f don t know how to deal with this situation repost because i had to edit my question so sorry if anyone come across this again amp x200b so tonight i wa just doing my thing when my boyfriend started messaging me out of the blue the first thing he said wa uhm so were you open to a threesome or not and that he found someone who wa willing to do one with u we ve talked about this before and i ve let him know that i m not open to something like that at all because i m way to insecure so i think it would sink our relationship he also told me once that he really want one but not with me this make me even more insecure because that would mean if he really want this he will have to break up with me overall it s a sensitive subject and not one i thought he would joke about i reacted while trying not to be too dramatic basically i asked him why he would suddenly ask that i also told him i wa on my period so it wasn t a good time to talk about this and that it get me worried when he say stuff like that after this i got some funny weird message about how my only right is the countertop which in my language make sense a a joke because of this i asked him if he wa joking and if so it wasn t the right joke to make he just said he got a bit too drunk with friend i ignored him for a bit and he told me he wa sorry and tried to videocall me i ignored the call because i didn t want to talk to him with people around him about this subject which i also told him later because he said sorry i wa le mad so i apologized for ignoring his call which i now regret later on he told me one of his friend wa single now so that wa what the threesome joke wa supposed to be about he also told me he didn t say sorry one of the girl who wa there told him he went too far and sent me that message another friend tried to videocall me i didn t know up until then that they were in on this conversation he told me that only me and the other girl didn t think it wa funny all other 5 people there were cracking up so he probably think i m overreacting and being too sensitive because of all this i m really hurt i ve been bullied and he know how insecure i am now these people have been laughing while all sending me these message and i feel like he doesn t care how much it hurt me i feel horrible about this these people know i m on my period how insecure i am about cheating and threesome and he let them call me without me knowing that it wasn t him i would be talking to good thing i didn t pick up one of the thing that hurt the most is that he didn t even say sorry someone else did it for him he seems to think he did nothing wrong but for me it feel like he crossed a lot of my boundary with this thanks so much if you re reading this i ve tried to keep it a unbiased a possible to get the best possible advice i ve ignored him the rest of the night he is sleeping now so any conversation will be in a while what would be the best way to go about this situation should i keep ignoring him until he say something or should i be the first to say something if so what can i say to make it clear to him how much this hurt me without coming across a overdramatic tldr my boyfriend went out drinking with friend and sent me some weird message he know i m sensitive about turn out it wa him and his friend laughing at the conversation and even videocalling me without me knowing it wasn t him he said sorry but it turn out that wa someone else a well he told me everyone but me and another girl thought it wa very funny i m feeling very hurt what would be the best way to go about this situation should i keep ignoring him until he say something or should i be the first to say something if so what can i say to make it clear to him how much this hurt me without coming across a overdramatic,0

i realized today i don t know what a healthy sex life is possibly triggering rant it really clicking with me now that my husband is sexually abusive back in the day he wa my first serious boyfriend and i wa saving sex for marriage so when he d whine about not having sex or pressing me to do other thing back then i thought he wa just being an impatient bitch and wrote it off a annoying but overall would go away after we got married but then we got married and it didn t stop i ended up getting unrelated chronic pain with sex for awhile and in general had a low sex drive while he would get angry if we only did it twice a week he d guilt me so bad about it all he wa never understanding about anything i wa feeling he wa too focused on letting me know how shitty i wa for not fucking him whenever he d like anyway today i wa thinking if i leave him and start dating again what doe a healthy sex relationship look like like is it weird that i want my husband to ask before we have sex or to ask before touching my private area it because he ll do it at the most random time like if i m walking by hell ask for a hug and a we are hugging stick his hand down my pant and touch my clit or rub my as like it s some kind of magic button that s going to make me want to instantly bang if we spoon in bed hell yank my pant down and start putting his dick up against me whether i m sleeping or not doesn t stop if i ask him nicely not to and doe his best to make me feel like shit if i would rather go back to sleep and that s only some of the b i go through so yeah how doe a normal relationship work how do you do consent in your sex life i m so confused if i m being just a weird a he is by having boundary or if i m right but anyway it honestly pathetic,1

am i making up boy to fall in love w since my boyfriend treat me badly so i don t really know where else to post this but i m curious to see if anybody ha any insight to provide it probably sound weird but this whole situation ha me kinda messed up emotionally tiny backstory that i won t go too deep into my boyfriend and i have completely fallen apart and i m pretty like disconnected from him at this point he just won t let me leave even tho he know he s hurt me and i m unhappy he force me to stay so i can wait for him to change bc he won t be like this forever due to a messed up sleeping pattern whenever i sleep i take melatonin which i know always make my dream more vivid and i can remember them when i wake up a lil better pretty close to every night i have different dream about a different type of guy and in the dream we fall for each other and the dream is pretty much just like a normal relationship y know me and the dude connect super well and then we re happy together that s the whole dream it s basically like watching myself be in a relationship w someone from a third person perspective but every time i wake up and remember my dream that i had w the boy there s this empty feeling i get and the dream guy subconsciously keep popping up in my brain like i miss them but they re not real people there shouldn t be any attachment so my question is have i actually reached this sad point where i don t feel loved by my boyfriend so i m dreaming of being loved and attaching myself to it instead or do y all think there s something else going on my life is kinda weird rn,1
my fiance 28f end up driving drunk everytime she go out i 24m have been dating my fiance for a little bit over a year and a half and we plan on getting married late 2020 4 month ago i wa deployed overseas and before that this particular issue never arose it seems like everytime she go out with her friend she end up getting extremely drunk and drive herself home i have brought this up to her after everytime and she ha always said she understands about the drinking and driving and it won t happen again because of her work schedule this is only the 3rd time that i can think of her doing this after i ve asked her not too tonight i knew she wa going out and when she got home she called me drunker then i ve ever heard her before and told me she drove home again she also said she took shrooms early in the night i m not happy about that but i m not sure how i should be upset with her for that in the time i ve known her she ha never used drug yet i know shes done them in the past with her group of friend that she still hang out with honestly i dont really know what to do i ve told her some of the thing she doe bug me and she ha promised not to do them again but a lot of the stuff i feel is unreasonable of me to ask and would end up making her have to leave her group of friend which isnt fair of me to ask tldr fiance continues to drive home despite me asking her not to she also put herself in situation that make me uncomfortable while drinking and i m not really sure what to do anymore,0
i feel like i m slowly losing my mind and i don t know what to do my current girlfriend 20f and i 22m have been dating since march 2016 everything started off fine and we were so happy in our relationship she wa the first girlfriend i ever had and i wa her first serious relationship a couple month after we started dating i started to see her darker side it seemed like she wa always in a bad mood and i wa always to blame i didn t know what i wa doing wrong considering she wa my first girlfriend so i tried to always give her the benefit of the doubt and did whatever i had to do to make sure she wa happy i had a full time job and tried to spend the most time i could with her but it wasn t always possible since she didn t have the same amount of freedom a i did at the time during the time we had a couple fight on and off of course nothing wa perfect and i didn t ever expect it be but i felt like we had way too many fight considering i never really did anything to upset her never made her worry about me cheating on her she wa the only person i ever spent time with i felt disconnected from the world and everything i did wa for her i feel like that s where i messed up fast forward to today i feel absolutely miserable all i ever think about is what we will argue about next i feel like she s always in my mind telling me what to do and how i should feel i feel trapped and lost i don t have any more friend because of her and even if i did we would never be able to hang out due to her attitude she would tell me that i would rather spend time with my friend and call me gay saying that i don t love her and that my friend are more important that s not even the worst part ever since we ve dated i can never go to a family birthday or anywhere close to family because she will spam my phone screaming and yelling at me because i m not texting her back and that s she s more informant than my family i feel so bad because i don t know if it s my fault that maybe she s right and that i should be with her for the last two year she s had this extreme hate towards my sister in law she would always call her a bitch for no reason and message her privately calling her the most awful of name my sister in law would run to me first telling me that i need to control her i m literally the most unproblematic person ever and because of her she s put me in so much drama and tension with my family that shouldn t even be there she s slowly getting over that now but i still feel like she ha hate toward my family in which i avoid bringing her to party or gathering not knowing what kind of drama she would stir up this wa my last resort today to turn to reddit and see what i should do before i lose it the worst part is that i love her i really do love her and i promised myself she would be the one i married but i don t know what s right anymore before her i wa perfectly happy and optimistic about everything but now i feel miserable and frustrated all the time because of her i hate to share my problem like this but it s all i can think of i don t want to feel sorry for myself or any of that i wanna break up but i always seem to go right back to her don t get me wrong we ve shared our happy memory together but they are so brief and get overshadowed by all the argument we have it suck it really suck i hope this is the right place to post this because i don t know what to do,1
i 21f think i am in a toxic relationship and desperately need some perspective hi everyone i can t tell if my relationship is salvageable or not and i really need help i have been typing and editing this for 3 hour and i m worried it s way too long for anyone to care about but please even if you can only skim or whatever i would really appreciate any perspective on this bc idk what to do tldr at end throwaway account a an attempt at privacy my boyfriend 25m and i 21f met at work i initiated the relationship and we have been together for 13 month now the good this relationship feel real compared to the others i ve been in we talk bluntly about everything from mental health to childhood trauma to our future to politics and more he say this is the first relationship he s been in that he actually care about and isn t just in for the sake of having a gf he tell me story he s never told anyone and talk about his feeling in way he say he never ha before he talk about our future together constantly and wa quick to dtr we are both kinda homebody and love spending lazy day off together he call me smart hardworking pretty gorgeous and constantly praise my body saying it s perfect he is the only person i ve been with that doesn t make me feel clingy we equally want to spend a much time a possible with each other and text throughout the day he s the only person i ve been with who want to cuddle a much a i do he sat down with me and had a mature conversation about wanting sex more often which we successfully figured out a system for he used to be really dismissive of my feeling and hard on me when i would have a bad day but after talking about it a few time early on thing got significantly better he make me feel special and safe and taken care of we went on a vacation to another state together and had an amazing time it wa bliss all of our coworkers and management at work love him he is charismatic funny talkative and helpful he is everyone s favorite and we are seen a a perfect couple the bad he s the first boyfriend i ve fought with and he constantly accuses me of overreacting guilt tripping and starting every fight most of our fight start because either 1 i say something that trigger his jealousy or 2 we have a miscommunication over text the jealousy is a huge factor he grew up with every relationship he saw ending in the woman cheating in high school he wa in a relationship off and on for 4 or 5 year where she cheated in the end he express discomfort when i wear le clothing but doe not tell me i can t he need me to text him consistently throughout the night so his thought don t wander especially if i m in a room with literally any other dude and he constantly make joke about how i better not have another man etc he get emotionally distraught if i mention any past relationship especially if i mention sex i am super confrontational and he is not so when we fight i constantly find myself trying to explain what i meant by whatever i said while he go completely silent and lay in his bed on reddit i beg him to explain why he is mad at me and how i can improve to avoid having the same fight again but he stay silent fight always end with me feeling like i compromised and gave in to his silence left to wait patiently for him to be normal again and pretend like nothing happened he doesn t say i love you i said i love you at month 4 i think and didn t need him to say it back right away since he didn t i don t say it very often but i do kinda wish he would say he love me after a year of being together where we ve talked about living together having dog in the future moving to another state eventually etc his mom got really good insurance after switching job a few month ago and he hasn t made any doctor dental or therapy appointment even though he will lose the coverage when he turn 26 at the end of this year he had a traumatic brain injury 2 year ago and need check ups for that and dental i constantly talk about how good therapy is and how much i think he would benefit from it since i m literally the only one he talk to besides coworkers and there are some thing i simply cannot help him through because i m involved jealousy being the main one he ha a generally bad outlook on life and hate everyone we both have depression so i kinda get it but at the same time he s really pessimistic he think no one can be trusted and anyone i e me who trust others is foolish when i tell him i feel bad for calling out of work bc it fuck over other people he say they would do the same to me without thinking twice so i should just do it we never go to my apartment i justify it because he ha a tv a bigger bed and ha a harder time sleeping than i do but i can t help but think about how i m always on his turf and he s never on mine he ha really bad road rage and play his music super loud when he drive which i just think is kinda an asshole move lol he also ha had expired tag on his car for a year even though it will pas smog if he make an appointment with his mechanic he wa pulled over for it 2 month ago and given a one month deadline to get it sorted so he is endlessly stressed he will get pulled over again he doesn t want kid and i think i might want kid but i don t know yet i am going through a really hard time right now i am in my last year of college with a lot of application and coursework and responsibility i found out i have adhd over the summer and have been trying to adjust to medication for it 3 week ago while my car wa parked on the street outside his apartment overnight a huge collision happened leaving my car totalled i can take the bus or walk to class but he is my primary source of transportation to work until i can find a new car i ubered one day when he couldn t drive me and it wa nearly 12 dollar to get to my 4 hour shift which is not cost effective at all my manager wa able to make our weekend shift when i don t have class the same so that we can carpool and i don t have to quit my job we had a fight yesterday that wa so stupid and really really bad he used a past fight a ammunition called me annoying and refused to apologize i am feeling really disrespected and like he is not being considerate or patient with me when i am having such a stressful time we have not talked at all today and i feel miserable i want to make thing work but every fight we have feel the same and nothing change i ve tried everything but he can t see a world where he could possibly be in the wrong in most of the fight we have and i feel like i have to leave him but i really don t want to i really do love him and i think we fit well together but he is so stubborn that i m worried some thing will never improve i ve been thinking all day about why i m scared to lose him and if i truly love him a a person or not i have been thinking about meeting with him and straight up saying that i m not happy in this relationship and i know it s an ultimatum and it s fucked up but here s a list of thing that i need to see change if you are willing to tell me how i can help you be happy in this relationship and you re willing to work on some shit essentially change for me then i want to be with you but if not i think i have to leave but i m fucking scared and i think that s wrong but i want to give him an opportunity idk what to do because now is the time in our relationship that i need him most but we have had two fight in the past week about petty bullshit and i just don t have time for it please help i m so desperate and i really need some perspective tldr my boyfriend is charismatic and loving most of the time but is incredibly jealous stubborn and show a need to power over me i have been encouraging him to work on his trauma and tell me if there is anything i can do to be better for him for the past year but he just give me the silent treatment and show improvement in some area but none in others i feel like a dog but i ve never been given a chance to improve a relationship before being broken up with i don t want to do the same to him i love him i want to give him a second chance should i,1

my boyfriend of 4 year told me today that he never want to marry me okay so my boyfriend 26m and i 24f have been together for just over 4 year now and thing have been fairly good overall we ve lived together for three year one spent living with my parent and the other two spent living together in our current flat i wa fine with the way our relationship wa progressing until about a year or so ago i love this man very much and can see myself spending the rest of my life with him and he ha always expressed similar feeling the issue is that whenever i have brought up the topic of marriage he ha always seemed pretty opposed to it he ll often give vague reason for this such a engagement ruin relationship and i just don t see the point in getting married when i attempt to discus thing further i would have dropped it but he ha switched opinion on this a few time sometimes he insists that he will eventually ask at a time when marriage is more financially viable neither of our job pay very well a we both work in retail i have always made it clear that i would never demand a big lavish ceremony but the discussion always dy there i have occasionally joked that if he didn t hurry up and propose to me that i d propose to him he ha always reacted to this suggestion poorly telling me that he d just say no out of principle today wa the day where it really dawned on me that this guy doesn t ever want to marry you a bit of context i m kind of a messy person and he s very neat and tidy we have talked about this and i ve made an effort to work on it but i do have relapse i struggle with depression and will sometimes find it very difficult to motivate myself after being at work all day so my space in the flat e g my desk or my side of the bed can get pretty messy today he made a joke to the effect of wooow if this is how badly you look after yourself then we should definitely never get married have kid now the kid comment didn t really bother me a i said i struggle with depression and am currently in waiting for psychiatric assessment to see if there s anything else that is wrong with me i wouldn t want to pas any of my issue onto future child so i am finding the idea of remaining child free increasingly appealing the thing that bother me and ha always bothered me is that he know i m interested in marriage and the constant uncertainty about his commitment to our relationship is really starting to weigh on me i m starting to think that my mental health issue may be more of an issue for him than he want to admit but he ha always denied this whenever i have brought it up i got a little bit snappy back at him and pointed out that we are still relatively young and have plenty of time to get our act together the conversation went a followed roughly summarised b is boyfried me is me me you shouldn t say never who know where we ll be in ten year time we might be very different people b laughing i can t wait to turn around to you in ten year time and say told you that you wouldn t change me feeling hurt so if i tried more and wa able to be better you d accept a marriage proposal b not if you proposed i d have to do it me so would you b getting twitchy why do you even want to get married me because i love you and i d like to be married to you b i couldn t deal with being engaged or getting married to you i d rather kill myself at this point i m feeling pretty destroyed and am too upset to continue the conversation he see that i m upset and back peddles a bit insisting that it s only because of the financial commitment and stress of getting married and ha nothing to do with me i don t know what to do should i continue to pursue a future with this man am i being unreasonable i d really appreciate some advice tl dr my boyfriend of 4 year who i want to marry implied that i m not marriage material when i suggested that thing may change in time he told me that i ll never change and that he d rather die than go through the financial and emotional stress of marriage,0

how i left him i just recently read an article about how to leave an abusive relationship and it damn near put me in a panic attack flashback suck even though it s been 5 year i want to tell my story of how i did it because i never know if anyone else need to read something like this to know it can be done i won t go into the abuse but suffice to say it got to the point where he kept a revolver on a tray table next to his chair i wa sure he would kill me how did i do it it took month i tried to leave twice but never had it together enough and ended up going back for more empty promise once i knew this wa it and he wa probably going to escalate to even killing me i started my plan we had just moved 5 address in 5 year because he had a problem with every single neighbor we ever had so it wa convenient at the time to switch the bill from my name to his to get new customer deal i still paid the bill they were just in his name i opened a saving account that he didn t know about i picked up extra call at work and put every cent i could into it without him getting suspicious i spoke to a few trusted friend at work about what wa going on so they could keep an ear out for any available apartment that allowed dog coincidentally a per diem coworker had an inlaw that she said i could check out i had a another coworker take my call for the afternoon told the ex i wa working on call and went to see it gave her the security deposit immediately and told get i had no idea when i would move in but i d let her know i had a large piece of luggage that i filled with clothes shoe and dog food i hid it under the bed i had my keepsake all in a box and never took them out after moving which wa very convenient then after a particularly horrible night i got up and went to work i knew he d be leaving about an hour after me i notified my bos i worked in a hospital that i wa leaving and it wa going to be horrible she contacted security and let them know she also let me leave so i could grab my thing i went home grabbed the luggage my dog my expensive instrument and my keepsake box i couldn t fit anything else in my car and he had an erratic schedule so i couldn t depend on having time for another trip before he d come home i got to my new home and called the police to let them know what i wa doing where i wa and that i would eventually need an escort to get the remainder of my thing i let me closest friend and family know where i wa and what wa going on i then sent him a text to let him know i wa gone i would be in touch about when i wa getting everything else and that i would not tell him where i moved to then i shut off my phone for three day it wa long and messy i ended up letting him contact me through social medium eventually but i wa out and not going back he never learned where i lived he did show up at my work twice but wa quickly escorted off the ground it wa the hardest thing i have ever done but i truly believe i m alive because of it 5 year later it seems like a different lifetime ago i don t even remember how desperate it all felt because i think i purposefully blocked it out i m a completely different person in a completely different life there s my very abridged story not sure if this help anyone but maybe someone will get the courage wishing health and happiness to you all,1

my 35f mom 63f won t stop pushing me to have a baby after multiple miscarriage a little background i got married last month to a great guy we have been together for a little over 3 year before him and i met i had gone through a somewhat difficult divorce one of the thing that made it so difficult wa that we had been trying to have a baby for several year and after 2 iuis i had two miscarriage the last one happened at 12 week when we had already told people i wa pregnant and then shortly after i found out my ex had been cheating on me suffice to say that whole time in my life wa very difficult that miscarriage wa the hardest thing i have ever had to deal with i wa a completely broken person for about a year because of it we had also spent thousand of dollar trying to conceive since our insurance didn t cover anything it honestly became almost an obsession because my life just revolved around pregnancy 24 7 baby blog ttc message board pinning baby item on pinterest it wa just my life fast forward to today all of my friend have kid my best friend brought her baby to our wedding she just had her in july and so she wa super tiny and cute my husband and i have talked about having a baby particularly because of my age it s in our plan but i don t want to rush or become a obsessed a i previously wa well literally the moment we were married my mom wa whispering in our ear that she want a baby now oh and it should be a girl like we have any control over that it s shocking to me that she would be so pushy since she wa never this pushy before and she know what i went through with the miscarriage we ve only been married for a month and she is literally mentioning me having a baby during every conversation even texting my husband about it i don t know where this is coming from and there wa honestly a point in my life when i accepted that there may be a chance i don t have a baby i am not going to put myself through financial debt and have my heart broken over and over again for something that may not even happen we plan on eventually seeing a fertility specialist but for now can t i just enjoy being a newly wed so how do i talk to her about this and get her to back off the last time she started to talk to me about having a baby a few day ago i reminded her of the miscarriage and she just responded that i got pregnant and that wa the important part it s beyond frustrating and it ha gotten to the point where i might just avoid talking to her tl dr my mom won t stop telling me i need to have a baby with my new husband even though i went through two miscarriage during my previous marriage,0
recovering from abuse do you find it hard for people to relate i try to talk to my closest friend about what i am going through but it seems like they dont see how devastating this ha been for me i got out of an extremely abusive 2 year relationship which i kept a secret for most of the duration into another one with a guy who said he would give me what i deserve but seems to actually be very selfish and mean to me occasionally because of his lack of maturity and they seem to just tell me that they dont understand why i am still with him then carry on with telling me about how their life are going it make me feel really lonely and stupid for talking about my feeling and expecting them to help me it would be nice to hear if other people have similar experience,1
weirdest empowering move doe anyone else find that after a suffocating relationship even the smallest action feel like a victory my abuser used to be particular about everything wanting me to do thing the right way i love washing up in hot soapy water and leaving the suds to fall off and he hated this and would always make me run stuff under the tap i feel so relieved when i can wash up and leave thing a soapy a i want probably one of the smallest thing he done to affect me but i think about it over and over when i m washing up doe anyone else have a habitat like this,1
i 28m think that my fiance 27f is going to break up with my after 11 year of being together and i m not sure what to think i have been with my fiancé for almost 11 year this november we dated for 8 and engaged for almost 3 we generally had an amazing relationship we went on multiple trip together almost every year prior to school i wa the best man at her brother wedding i have a good relationship with her parent we have a dog together however about 3 year ago she moved across the country for school i followed her and we lived together for those 3 year this wa the first time we lived together and there wa a lot of headbutting a first i can say at time i wa not the most supportive partner she wa busy with school and sometimes i d be playing video game trying to stay quiet but it would distract her we did get into some fight while living together but overall i thought we were happy there were some rough month where she d be tired with school and not want to be intimate sometimes we didn t have sex for almost a month which made my feel like shit and unwanted anyway over the past year i had 3 major fuck ups where we went out and i blacked out made an asshole out of myself and embarrassed her in front of friend and classmate i guess i can say i have an issue where i don t know when to stop might be due to my social anxiety but i don t know while she wa in school i tried my best to support her i d drive her to school pretty much cover most financial thing make dinner do all the grocery shopping take care of the pup she supported me in my pursuit to get into a master program which i currently just started this august which is in a different state she just graduated from her program this past august and moved back to our home state to start work there since there isn t really a job market around my school unless she traveled 1 5hours one way i wa super bummed out about u not living together and maybe i expressed it not the right way now she recently did a one month backpacking trip in europe with some of her classmate which even though i wa happy for her i wa still sort of bummed out because we weren t able to do much traveling or anything together for 3 year while she wa in school before she left for europe i know we had our issue but we were still talking and she came to visit me and everything seemed fine when she came back from europe she visited me and i could tell something wa off i tried to press her to let me know what wa going on but she couldn t really express it i ended up going on a trip for school and she sent me a text explaining how she wa feeling and how she doesn t think she could marry me anymore that she wa conflicted and wasn t sure what to do she ended up driving back home while i wa on my trip since then we exchanged some text we talked on the phone for a few hour yesterday and she expressed the same thing in the text on how she is conflicted she is scared and not sure she can continue the relationship she is supposed to visit me in a few week i m assuming to give me back my ring i told her i didn t want this relationship to end we have so much history together and in the end i am so fucking scared of not being with her she pretty much wa my rock we had common ideal thought and goal i saw my future with her i thought we would tackle the world together but now it all kind of crashing down we haven t really talked in 2 day and i don t know what to expect i just wanted to kind of share this and see if anyone else went through the same situation it doesn t seem like it is going to get any easier tl dr i believe my fiancé of 11 year is going to break up with me due to my fuck ups and our rough 1 2 year living together while she wa in school i am not sure how to think or feel seeing if anyone ha any advice or ha been in a similar situation,0

my f30 bf m31 told me on my 30th birthday he s worried i reached my sexual peak posting here because i need an outlet for my rage and hurt my bf and i have been dating since january we moved in together in july tuesday wa my 30th birthday i had been dropping hint to my bf for awhile that birthday mean something to me and that i m usually extra sensitive at that time one of the thing we fight about is one of my friend a high school ex my contact with the ex ha been an issue because of my bfs jealousy after awhile i decided that i would slowly stop chatting a much to my ex it s mostly meme gossip about our other high school friend and gaming anyway back to my birthday the first thing my bf say to me when i wake up is have you been texting your ex lately needle to say my extra sensitivity took offence to this that wa the first thing he thought about i handed him my phone and told him to just look at the conversation he s previously gone through my phone i tried to shake it off but the day never really recovered he wa cold and distant one of the reason why he is so jealous of my ex is that the ex and i have had a three some something he desperately want to do and ob about this threesome issue becomes the end result of every fight we have it always come back to the fact that i experienced all these thing in the past that he spent all his youth in a gruelling education program and didn t get to have fun the way i did so anyway our fight ended with him saying that he s worried i reached my sexual peak before i met him and that he s never going to experience a threesome it wa a nice 30th birthday present and also the only one i got to say that basically i m old a fuck and apparently not sexually adventurous anymore i am definitely a token of affection physical touch kind of person he is usually thoughtful and romantic but i got nothing of that on a day when i really needed it i definitely think he ha manic depression or something similar so i do try to keep that in mind when assessing his behaviour question ha anyone experienced something similar how do you get past rude comment that your partner say even if they say them in the heat of the moment or without thinking how do you deal with intrusive negative thought your partner ha that affect your relationship the threesome ha become such a negative thing to talk about that any interest i had in having one ha evaporated tldr my threesome obsessed jealous boyfriend is worried we ll never have a threesome and let his negative thought about that ruin my birthday,0

i m sick of my boyfriend criticizing everything i like and i don t know what to do anymore tl dr my boyfriend always make bad comment about the thing i like and i don t know if i m just oversensitive or if i really have a reason to be hurt angry by them i need advice to make both of u happy i ve been dating my boyfriend for 2 year now and i feel like he s constantly putting down all the thing i like and i really want a second opinion am i too sensitive and do i even have something to be annoyed and kind of angered by i know i can be over sensitive quite often and i just really need advice on how to deal with this and know if my reaction is appropriate whenever we watch a movie and i m the one who chose it seems like he always make sure to go on and on about how it wa a terrible movie or he point out all the illogical thing that happened in it for example we watched the movie the killing of a sacred deer and when it ended i told him how much i loved it despite the plot that is quite confusing if you don t know the background behind the story and the odd acting i just found it charming that s all he then go on about how it wa a waste of his time absolute garbage and that he s angry he ll never get those two hour of his life back after having watched it now this would be fine if he didn t keep on bringing it up telling me i m pretentious every time i tell him why i like it people who are pretentious really annoy me and i m scared i actually am i m scared i m just getting hurt at silly thing and that i m oversensitive he doe this for a lot of the movie and even music i like saying they re pretentious another thing i really like is drag queen ever since i ve started watching rupaul s drag race i m completely obsessed and i think what they do is absolutely amazing and admirable i know i m still only at the surface of the drag world but it brings me such joy to see them perform when i spoke to him about it he kept telling me he think they re degenerate and that they re ill now his point of view on the lgbtq community is something we very much disagree on it s not a performance art it s an excuse they use to spread their degeneracy when i tell him i feel a if he s trying to paint them a horrible people and a borderline monster he get so angry and tell me don t put word in my mouth i ve resorted to never talk about drag queen in front of him and once again maybe i m just being too sensitive but today something happened and it just really hurt me i ve been reading a book by a japanese author and the plot completely fascinated me i couldn t put it down so i wanted to tell him the story because he s not much of a reader so i go ahead and do just that and i wa so excited to share this with him a i m telling him the plot he cut me and say this is very japanese it s so silly none of this make sense it s really stupid once again i m probably being oversensitive but that really hurt so i just agreed and said my story telling skill aren t doing it justice so i keep going which is honestly my mistake the whole time he s really quiet so i ask him why he isn t saying anything once again my mistake i know and then he just go i m just stopping myself from saying anything bad you know how you react i then go very quiet and when he asks me why i m so quiet i just agree with him it s stupid and the plot is bad this is usually what i do so we can get over with it and then he just go no i don t need this i don t need this you know how i am why are you being like this and proceeds to hang up i know this is my fault and most of these are my fault i just would really like a second opinion should i just put up with it should i stop reading watching listening to these thing i don t know what to do anymore and the fact i m feeling bad due to this is extremely selfish what can i do to solve this and make u happy,0

how do i 25f break up with my boyfriend 37m who won t move out i m in a toxic relationship and want to end it my boyfriend and i have been together for a little over a year and it s clear that we aren t compatible long term we re constantly arguing over petty detail our sex life is non existent and i ve reach the point that i no longer even like him a a person due to the constant stress the issue is we live together in a house that i own and have broken up a couple of time in the past without success typically i get so frustrated that i ask to end thing we give each other space for a few day and eventually we end up together again nothing is actually resolved and we don t connect in any deep or meaningful way it s more like i get so tired of fighting that i settle for continuing the relationship after a short period of no conflict since that s easier than trying to force him to accept that we ve broken up i know that i ve contributed my equal share to making this relationship worse and worse so i m at the point where i want to end it for good so that this doesn t go on forever i want to experience life on my own and learn how to be happy with myself a i feel that this contributes a huge amount to having healthy relationship however if i tell him this we re going to repeat the same breakup cycle and i don t think it will last he truly belief we re meant for each other can work through any issue and should stay together long term no matter how bad thing get this seems a little extreme but since i own the house we live in can i just collect his belonging and kick him out every time i ve tried to give him advanced notice he ignores it and continues a if nothing is wrong he owns no furniture we have no shared finance and his only payment is a recurring monthly charge that he transfer to me on the 1st through venmo to cover living expense tldr boyfriend and i have a rollercoaster of a relationship and i want to end it i ve tried a few time in the past and he won t accept breaking up what s the best way to get him to move out from the house that i own,0
my m20 girlfriend f20 of a year and a quarter say that i need to learn to control my emotion to be le panicky and that this will fix the vast majority of our problem how can i be more in control of my emotion is this healthy hey this is my first ever relationship and honestly i felt extremely emotionally mute before it i hadn t cried since i wa a little kid before this relationship and now i cry almost every time we re in a fight or when i m really sad she emotionally opened me up in both a positive and negative direction anyways we have a lot of fight the most recurring one is generally me doing something stupid to give an example the fight we re in now started because she had asked me to bring the nintendo switch because i wa coming over to see her family i assumed she just meant the switch itself and grabbed it on my way out i went to see her hugged her wa talking just fine and once we were in the car she wa like wait did you bring the dock and i wa like oh no i didn t think you wanted me to bring it it got her slightly annoyed a she tell me later not because of the one small thing but because i very frequently make stupid mistake like that and my common sense is extremely lacking so she get annoyed i m trying to reason with her tell her that i m sorry i made this mistake i really didn t think you wanted me to bring the dock i thought she wanted to just play it while we were in the car but she wanted to play it w her little cousin on the tv with me it s not a big deal and we re not able to see each other much but she wa just staying annoyed so a huge learning curve for me in this relationship is that she want to be cheered up following a fight or when she s only slightly annoyed when she s really annoyed she just want me to make it up to her and fix the problem which is usually very very difficult my problem is that i get emotional when she s mad at me it make it hard for me to do what cheer her up be funny make her laugh etc but in this instance she s still only a little irritated so after we re parked somewhere i start poking her and tickling her and i see her smiling and getting annoyed laughing like your girlfriend doe when you re being annoyingly cute so i tell her alright here s what s gonna happen i m gonna play some music you love we re gonna drive to the store and buy a gingerbread house and it s all gonna be alright right it s hard to translate my tone through text but this wa done with giggle and poking and pointing it wa playful but i put on one of her favorite song and she instantly changed got annoyed and said really you think you re just gonna play a song and it s all gonna go away and i wa like well no it s a start but we re gonna get back on track and do normal stuff and she wa like so you want to prolong this instead of ending it right now and i feel inside me the usual feeling of regret shame knowing i fucked up and i apologize and now the responsibility is on me to keep cheering her up only i m upset now my comedy isn t there i don t feel like i can be funny and i start fumbling and she start getting really really upset and sad for context we ve gone through ton of fight just like this and she s getting extremely fed up with me not being able to cheer her up after a fight so for the rest of the day i spent trying to remedy this to be met with stone cold disappointment and it only got worse with the day but at one point she left for a bit and came back to me all doe eyed and looking up at me which is an obvious fucking sign and i took it and i said a brief sincere apology and picked her up and spun her and she started giggling and bit my neck playfully and i put her down and smiled and pushed her hair back and she gave me this look of still being sad i wa like come on baby girl let s get these christmas decoration up alright and she wa like i don t want to put them up until i m feeling better and give me that look again and i suddenly realize i m out of material and i begin to panick and this make her so so upset we spent like 5 more hour together and it just got progressively worse but at a certain point she just come up to me and say i will do literally everything else i m begging you please just be your normal self please just be your happy goofy normal self and i try my fucking hardest and i even convince myself but she doesn t feel like it s me and tell me so and is cry and freaking out which isn t helping my mood i hate seeing her so upset but then her family got home and made u dinner and because were in front of them we re both acting normal i helped her set up a new roomba her family got and everything started seeming normal i wa all playful and wa like alright guess what time it is and pulled out her high school yearbook and we made fun of all of her classmate then started making the gingerbread house it wa really nice she wa playful and i wa making joke and it wa feeling really good then i did something small that annoyed her and i got a little sheepish i guess and she wa like hey don t be so cautious and i wa like alright i won t then i guess i acted cautious again and she wa like i just asked you not to do that and you did it again and started looking upset and now i ve got that rush of emotion again and i feel scared and i m pissed that i started something again so now the full rest of the night wa me failing to say anything to cheer her up or make her happy and her falling deeper and deeper into this sad mood and i m freaking out i left in tear telling her how sorry i am for disappointing her i sent long apology text last night with no answer and texted her again the middle of today she responded about an hour later just saying hi i texted once again my apology and the conversation moved to christmas gift for my family and hers and that we re going to meet up at a mall tomorrow once she wa home this wa just a few hour ago we called and i told her we needed to have a long honest talk about what i need to be doing and why what i m doing is wrong she told me i get too emotional and need to be more in control that s what cause almost all of our problem once i do some tiny thing to annoy her i get all freaked out and can t calm her down and it snowball and snowball into huge fight she said i need to work on that and i need to have more common sense i need to think about my action more and put more thought into thing she need me to be in a good mood to pull her out of a bad mood in her word how are you going to look at me all sad and upset and expect me to be happy out of that by the end of the call she wa laying with her head down and i said you tired and she said yeah and i said alright ive gotta be up early too i love you so much thank you for the advice and thank you for understanding i m really excited to see you tomorrow and i love you then she look at me all annoyed and is like so you really don t think it s a good idea to end this on a happier or more positive note and i wa like well i thought i wa with what i m saying and she wa like yeah okay and said good night and hung up i ve been up since trying to find resource about controlling emotion please help me out here is my

this shit is not normal so this is old but about 3 year ago before i even met or married my current amazing supportive husband i wa in a very abusive relationship that lasted for 6 to 7 year i wa 15 at the time starting highschool so fairly young even before then i wa already not confident in myself and fresh out of middle school which wa bully no friend central for me i met him in band class and he wa that cool mysterious i barely talk type of guy well we got into a relationship and after about 3 month i realized oh well shit he really mean but hey i loved him so so much i didnt really give no mind to it he started to be physically violent towards me and emotionally a well well i ll skip to the point he had a female friend named jessica not real name they dated before we got together and this wa when you had those popular blackberry phone transitioning to iphones and android so he had an iphone and he always kept it with him but had no password and i know you shouldn t be snooping but he kept talking about this friend he had and how great she wa so i snooped while he wa showering and saw sexual nasty message to her and wa like wow okay he cheating on me i confronted him and i regret just not walking away or leaving right there it turned into an all out war and he kept hitting me saying i wa accusing him and how awful i wa say the guy who wa beating the crap out of me for snooping on his phone i still did not leave and every year he would dump me and then beg for me back about 6 time this happened and me being stupid took him back every single fucking time well one day a video went around the school of a sex tape of me and him having sex not easy sex but rough i m fully naked sex i wa bullied everyday and he did nothing said nothing and when i accused him of spreading it he said he did not it wa his bestfriend and it wasn t an unknown fact that his friend wa a douche so i believed him until around the end of the relationship i found out he had spread it to keep me from leaving him because no one want a whore word from him i had to switch school and went to a small 80 kid school and guess what he folowed me there and transferred with me i wa so happy i could be with him and and i wa there for 2 year until i graduated well during the school year hed take me into the hall way and scream and cuss me out and i d be cry during class and the teacher and student heard but no one did shit well then he moved an hour away from the school and he still went to the school with me now during the relationship he ha no father and his mother wa a drug addict a well a a alcoholic who smoked alot shes curse at me and scream and tell me how i m taking her son away and he a momma boy so if i said anything about it hed hit me and say well at least my mom not a fat lazy bitch my mom hated him and she would refuse to take me to see him until i begged her to so his mom is crazy and in and out of relationship with crazy men so it s a rollercoaster of disaster also he moved into a trailer park they sold there perfectly good home for a trailer and then blew through the money in a month not kidding 500 000 gone in a month so they were always asking me for ride and money constantly well in the new school my dad started a new job and my new school doe not have bus system so i had to get dropped off an hour before he went to work and then my ex mom would pick u up on her way home from work until she quit her job then we would have to bum ride off of people to get to my house well we came up with a plan and id spend wednesday and thursday there so his mom bf could take u to school and then we d walk from school to my house and the day my dad didnt work she d drive an hour to his house pick him up then pick u up from school and then drive another hour out to drop him off at home this went on for 4 month well the night i spent there were awful he would sexually assualt me and basically slam me against the wall hold my head down and suffocate me with his penis and i mean i have a horrible gag reflex and hed keep going at me until i threw up hed touch me when i d say no stop and just shove his finger up there and hold me down and just keep going at me and some night he get on top of me and hold me down and just rape me even if i wa cry for him to stop it hurt to write this i went to a gynecologist for a checkup once and she asked me if i wa okay because i had bruising around my vagina it wa embarrassing hed beat me everyday nonstop and then tell me if i told my family hed kill them and then me so i wa scared and said nothing i had bruise everywhere and would blame it on something else when people would ask me where they are from one day i went to the er because my hand wa fucked up cut down my wrist but wa able to be sewed up and i ve had 11 surgery just to try and get the feeling back into my hand i m crippled in my left arm now he did it to me and i m glad i barely felt it until after because i went into shock i dont want to get into detail of how it happened because even talking about it i feel like having a panic attack his mom also knew he wa beating me but didnt care i still didnt leave him everyday hed call me fat and ugly or a whore no one would love you like i do if you leave me you d die alone and i believed him i wa gaining weight due to the depression i had because of him and the fact that i couldn t text my friend because it wa considered cheating in his eye and deserves punishment i also had lost all my friend because of him i wa alone i tried killing myself and went to a mental hospital but felt free when i wa there because he couldn t get me until i left then my life fell to shit my grade dropped i had no friend and i wa gaining weight to were i went from 120 to 140 so my self confidence dissapeared and i made a plan on my 18th birthday i d kill myself with a gun my dad kept in his safe since i knew the combo for emergency but one day his mom got into a fight with my mom since my mom couldn t pick him up anymore so i stayed home got taken to school an hour early and picked up by my dad friend well he did not like that my ex would say awful thing about my family and then hed get mad because i stopped packing him a lunch because i didnt like to do it he can get a box one like every one else he accused me of pigging out or cheating anything he could do just to fuck with my head tell me i m worthless without him i need him ect well his mom lost there only car so he had to drop out around the end of the school year and my mom thank god refused to take me to his house anymore so he wa an hour away from me with no way to end up at my house no more going to school it wa heavenly but i still wanted to die my worth had dropped and i no longer see myself a a girl but an ugly fat unloved pig like he taught me it wa nearing my 18th birthday just 5 more month to go until i die we were still going out until the last day of school then i saw him the love of my life a beautiful caramel coloured he love when i say this boy with glass long curly hair dark purple at the time and clothes that said i m homeless lol he wasn t he wa in cps he walked into the class room sat down near me and my breath wa taken away all the bad thought i had of myself gone i know some people dont believe in true love but i did in that moment i know this isn t a love story but still well i never saw him before because i wa in the am class and he wa in the pm class they had put the two class together for the last day of school i tried to talk to him but couldn t figure out how to till i saw him playing skyrim on his laptop and we clicked and gave eachother our number that day i went home and texted my ex and dumped him because i felt beautiful for the first time in year and confident he did not like that he threated me and told me hed kill me and my family i blocked him and cried so hard and told my mom to take my phone or i d take him back because when you ve been with someone for so long abusive pr not it s hard to think you can live without them and the bad memory out weighed the good well i didnt talk to beautiful boy all summer until the first week of school when i stayed for the pm class to hang out with a cool girl and he wa there we exchanged number again and started talking and i texted him one day on my way to school i like you and he transferred that week to the am class to be with me since then i never looked back our one year wedding anniversary is janurary 17th he is patient and kind and i love him he take care of me and understands what i went through i wouldn t be alive without his kindness and the confidence i had in myself this is about venting my story and you can vent your a well i m here to listen you can get out i found my out

i 18f left my boyfriend 18m because all my friend called him abusive but now i m having second thought that i wa the problem to start off with we had been dating for 8 month and it wa my first ever relationship and his second long term one his first had ended explosively and had been widely regarded a extremely toxic due to his ex who i ll call abbey however he himself ha a lot of issue especially regarding anger for example 1 he would often blow up at me whenever i made a mistake calling me baby retard or spoiled or yelling at me for cry one of his common thing wa to say that i had never had any real problem so there wa no reason for me to be upset he would also frequently tell me that my depression wa fake and stupid and that i had nothing to be depressed about however this issue only occurred when he wa very angry my friend despised him for this and still do in the later month of our relationship i hid the fact that we were dating from them he had the mindset of eye for an eye and that if he wa hurting then i should be too 2 on a few occasion i caught him texting abbey early on i didn t think much of it just reminded him that he said he had no contact with her she had told the entire school that they were still dating and having sex whenever he and i initially got together however he insisted that this wasn t true and that they had broken up a year ago most people labelled her crazy and moved on including me but in july when i wa in another state one of my friend coincidentally drove by a restaurant to see him having a meal with her on the patio when i confronted him he lied but then ultimately broke down to say that she had wanted to meet up to apologize and he felt he couldn t tell me or i would break down admittedly i had made a big deal of her in the past and wa very insecure about her and their relationship soon after his location showed he wa in her apartment complex yes i feel dirty for checking and when i brought that up he turned his location off and berated me probably fair and said that his family friend lived there a well 3 we were long distance in the end and he forbade me from having male friend and going to any party which is probably fair he also exploded when i told him an old friend wa visiting probably fair too a the friend used to have a crush on me now these issue paint him in a terrible light and that s all that my friend see when they look at our relationship however i know that he went through the worst he wa frequently beaten told he wasn t good enough etc and he knew he had issue that he needed to work on and resolve he wanted to seek treatment and in his word get better he loved me and wanted to be together forever now i feel a though i abandoned him and downplayed his issue maybe i wa at fault a well i wa very insecure and extremely clingy especially after discovering that he met up with his ex he sacrificed a lot to be with me in the beginning and when we were long distance in the end he forgave me when i went to a party there are ton of success story in relationship like this story of people working through their issue to have long beautiful relationship did i give up too soon did i overreact to certain thing he tell me i wa just a at fault a him and i m starting to believe that due to my high expectation i just want an outside perspective a i tend to be overdramatic tl dr i left my boyfriend because of his anger issue and now i feel guilty because i wa at fault too and i abandoned him when he needed me most,1

i left my husband today i 27f left my husband 29m of almost 6 year last night i finally realized he is verbally abusive and most likely narcissistic while i have gotten better about standing up for myself i am a pretty timid shy introvert that struggle with communication and he is an outspoken very opinionated extrovert where do i even begin when i first met him i thought he wa gay this wa purely based on stereotype and many of the people i have encountered since the start of our relationship 7 year ago think the same about 4 year ago i had this weird suspicion that he wa hiding something from me in the middle of the night i checked his phone and found a hookup app where he wa asking guy for dick pic when i confronted him about it he said that since we weren t having a much sex a he would ve liked i made him feel unattractive so he wa reaching out for attention he said the reason he wa asking guy for photo is because it s easier than asking girl that wa the night i lost all trust a year after the dick pic incident a piece of trash woman that both my husband and i had met year ago before we had even met each other came back into our life my husband apparently had sex with her back when he wa 16 and when he brought it up to her she had no memory of it he spent the latter part of the evening saying thing like you don t remember it wa in the back of my car in front of my face she continued to come to my house and i noticed a lot of flirtation between the two he even accidentally called her baby in front of me twice i woke up after a night of drinking with him not in bed the first time i found him on the couch in the living room and she wa on the other couch the second time they were both asleep in our guest bed he claim they didn t have sex his reasoning he still had clothes on when i found him in there so there s no way he wa also so drunk that even if he did have sex with her how could he have been smart enough to put his clothes back on one time she showed up unannounced on our anniversary i went to my bathroom and cried on the floor when he came and found me i told him to make her leave and he said he wouldn t wow just typing this make me realize how much of an idiot i sound like about a year ago this girl told my best friend that they slept together unfortunately she is such a drunk and homewrecker that i m not even sure if she would ve even remembered the sex if it actually happened so she s not a credible source around that same time he picked up a job where he did networking event a lot of them were at night and held at restaurant and bar one night he just never came home and he never texted or called me i contacted my mother in law first thing the next morning and she immediately started checking county jail and hospital around 10 am while i wa at work he finally contacted me and said his phone died he got really drunk and ended up sleeping at a guy s house he met that night he made it seem like it wa not a big deal during this time i wa extremely paranoid for obvious reason i wa constantly checking verizon to see who he wa texting i started noticing him texting the same number constantly and when i googled it wa an out of state number attached to a gym i d never heard of one night he wa coming home from work and he said his phone wa dying and that we should stop texting maybe because he wa using a gps several minute later i checked his text history online and he wa still texting this number after he told me his phone wa about to die fucking heartbreaking i never dared mention this to him because he would accuse me of snooping or lying or whatever lot of crazy thing between then and now including odd text message and inappropriate back massage while laying on a sofa both with guy but i recently found out from a good friend that my husband doe coke and ha been doing it for year he told me that my husband mentioned to him one time that i found a baggy in the dryer and then laughed about it because i had no idea it wa once filled with cocaine i wasn t ready to confront him about it yet until one night when he left our house around 4 am our security camera cut off and when it cut back on his car wa gone an hour and a half later the camera cut off again and when it come back on his car is back i noticed this disappearing act the next morning and my first thought wa that he wa going out and doing coke he told me he went to a gas station and ate a fig newton and drank a soda in his car because i bitch at him so much about spending money i didnt believe him my friend who alerted me about my husband s coke usage told me that two of our male acquaintance told my friend at two separate occasion that my husband had first given them coke then asked to suck their dick or offered to masturbate in front of them when i confronted my husband about this he acted surprised and wanted to reach out to these two guy and find out exactly what wa said he say this never happened and he acted extremely surprised and concerned of course he never reached out to them i decided to look through his email on his computer the day after the fig newton incident and noticed under the folder important he had requested access to his keepsafe photo vault the night before i decided to download the app and use the access code emailed to him and bam picture of his penis everywhere one picture wa of him naked in front of the bathroom mirror holding his dick and sucking a dildo attached to the wall i wa horrified the picture were from about 2 year ago and he say he didn t send them to anyone but i just don t believe him another shot at therapy and it came out that he had been struggling with his sexuality and that i wa the only who made him question whether or not he wa gay so he experimented and felt embarrassed and disgusted at his action except why keep them in your photo stash two year later if that is the case the therapist asked if he is gay or bi and he said no again i don t believe him i admitted in therapy that while it would be an adjustment and a shock i would not leave him if he were to come out a bi but that we had originally agreed on a closed relationship and therefore i would leave him if he wa acting on his fantasy my husband talked down to me a lot he s one of those asshole that give you the biggest look of disgust and the most dramatic eye roll when you haven t heard of something before like wow you didn t know that eye roll look of disgust he also get super angry when we are in a fight which cause me to shut down and not respond i also start cry which he absolutely hate his reasoning is why cry when we can just fix it i ve never apologized to someone so much for my tear i decided enough is enough i left though he s never hit me he threatened to burn down the house murder suicide etc i quickly took one of my dog to my mom s house when i returned to the house to get more of my thing he had already taken my work laptop and let the air out of one of my tire he told me to return our dog or he would damage my laptop since i knew he wa somehow going to get my dog anyway i gave in he guilt tripped me and said it really show how you care more about your work stuff than our dog i m currently staying at my mom s and his text are absolutely insane from anger to desperation to love and kindness and back to anger he keep blaming me for leaving him with all the home responsibility e g our pet the laundry no grocery for him i lol ed at the last one i keep wanting to go back to the house and just take care of everything so i don t feel shamed for abandoning everything but i know he s just trying to reel me in he s currently piling all of our christmas stuff in our driveway and threatening to throw it all away of course it s all on our security camera so i get to watch it happen yay while i am lucky to not have any child with him we do own a house a well a a business our business is his primary job although it is at the very start and we have not made enough money to even pay him so he work a side gig making a whopping 600 a month i make the money in the house so i wouldn t even know how to split it with him or if i

my 24f boyfriend 25m doesn t think my body deserves compliment for some background my boyfriend and i have been together for over a year like many woman my age i have been dealing with a low self esteem due to a lowered metabolism and changing body i also struggled with chronic illness for several year that made it difficult to work out and my doctor told me i shouldn t despite this i could tell working out wa important to my boyfriend so i tried to go to the gym with him once or twice a week i ve even gone on run with him i am fortunate to have started some new medication and am feeling a lot better but he and i haven t gone to the gym in a while due to the holiday lack of motivation illness etc whenever i try to complain to my boyfriend about my self esteem his response is something along the line of yeah then you need to work out and is never positive and uplifting he never tell me he like my body the other night i tried to tell him that i wa struggling and he said we should start a strict diet counting out calorie and tracking our weight while i am all for trying to lose weight i explained to him that i wa nervous to do those thing because i wa anorexic in high school and calorie and weight loss were my trigger he became really upset because we have to do it the right way i d finally had enough and decided to call him out on his negative response because they re hurting my self esteem he told me that it is important for him to have a girlfriend that is fit and will take part in that lifestyle with him i asked how he doesn t see how that response in itself wa hurtful and he responded with it s not mean it s the truth he ended up cry the rest of the night for reason he couldn t figure out and i got to console him until we went to sleep i left after he went to sleep because i didn t want to see him in the morning the next morning he called and we fought he told me that he ha the fundamental belief that people don t deserve compliment for thing they don t put effort into therefore my body doe not deserve any compliment at this point i am livid and tell him that his response and belief are hurtful and i don t understand why he s okay with upsetting me a much a he is i try to explain to him that it is normal for people to want compliment especially from their s o he think i am an asshole for shutting him down and putting value in a societal convention he is dead set on keeping his opinion and i am sick to my stomach that he feel this way about my body he s typically sweet and i have no idea how to move forward from here what should i do i think it s important to mention that i am not obese i am a size 6 140 pound i could just stand to lose ten or so tl dr when i complain to my boyfriend about my body he tell me to work out or diet when i told him that his response are hurting my self esteem and it would be nice to hear a compliment every once and a while he say he doesn t think my body deserves compliment,0

me 25 f with my bf 31 m of 8 month the way he acted at thanksgiving ha changed how i see him amp idk what to do bf and i have been dating for abt 8 month now and i invited him to my mom s house for thanksgiving he met my mom and sibling before but had never been to my mom s house about an hour away from our city since my mom doe most of the cooking everyone else will always help out with thing like setting the table cleaning up etc my 3 sibling age 22 30 and i always pitch in and don t just expect our mom to do everything while everyone else wa cleaning up bf just sat at the table it wa awkward because literally everyone else wa busy he wa the only one just sitting there playing a game on his phone he didn t even bring his own plate over to the dishwasher or even say thank you when my sister took his dirty dish and napkin off the table from right in front of him my sister wa obviously pissed off and this started to bother me a little i realized he hadn t said thank you at all to my family or offered to help in any way not even thing like asking if anyone else wanted a drink refill or anything if i wa at someone s mom s house for the first time i would go extra extra out of my way to be helpful and polite we stayed over that night and in the am he came back from taking a shower and saw me making the bed and asked me what i wa doing a if it wa ridiculous for me to be making a spare bed that i d slept in normally i wouldn t think much of that comment but after how he d been the day before it stung for some reason i wa a little miffed by all this but also figured maybe he didn t know or didn t realize or felt awkward nervous or wa just in a bad mood or something so when we were driving back i said to him hey when we have meal at our house we all pitch in to help a little because it s too much for just my mom since she s on her own now i know you didn t mean any harm but next time my family will really appreciate it if you could help out a little bit more not yelling at him or anything again just trying to clear thing up i figured he would quickly apologize or explain and that would be that he got really mad at me i couldnt believe it i wa trying really really hard to not ridicule him and keep my tone breezy and be empathetic but he wa so offended asked why i wa calling him an asshole told me that i wa being really uptight and way overreacting even implied that my mom must be somehow abusive or something to make me so worried about something like this this turned into a whole screaming match and i had to pull over the car because i started cry because i didn t want to make it a whole thing and i hadn t been that mad about it to begin with just wanted to clear up a little thing that bothered me a bit but it really really upset him we talked it out a little more and calmed down and eventually got back to our city and i dropped him off at his place we haven t hung out since bc we were both busy with other thing over the weekend but all our text n conversation have been normal amp friendly sweet ever since the whole thing seems very petty now but it s still just sort of bothering me and i don t like that it s kind of changed the way that i see him if bf had just apologized or even just said i had a headache i didn t realize i wa drunk or whatever next time i ll help out that feel very different but also i m worried that maybe he s right and i am overreacting and am being uptight and i feel really bad that i upset him so much because i didn t mean to i don t want to be girl who dump bf because he didn t clean off his thanksgiving plate or w e but the whole circumstance still just ha me sort of freaked out is this something petty that i should just get over or is it actually a big deal tl dr new ish bf came to thanksgiving at my mom s house for the first time i felt his behavior wa a tiny bit rude and when i asked him politely about it he freaked out i feel really conflicted about what i should do because it s sort of changed how i see him but also i feel bad for upsetting him,0
i 32m asked my wife 31f for divorce this weekend should i go through even with our 2 2yo amp 5yo kid i 32m asked my wife 31f for divorce this weekend should i go through even with our 2 2yo amp 5yo kid i guess we ve always had small fight and argument but i can only really recount big fight to maybe about 2 3 time in 12 year we ve been together 2019 hasn t been the best year for our family i had some trouble with my business and incurred a lot of debt they are all gone now except maybe about 2 3000 credit card debt that wa planned to be all paid for end of this year so i wa really looking forward to 2020 a it would have been a year to restart and get back to where we once were in 2019 i had to cut my wife s monthly spending to half from 5k to 2 5k while i took care of all the bill mortgage debt my wife wa stayed home to take care of our kid and family but she started working to cover some of the monthly spending while i appreciated her gesture it actually backfired i guess her mindset of i m making money now so i have money to spend now kind of took over her she spent 5k in 1 month on her credit card without even realizing i only found out when i opened up the mail thinking it wa my cc statement when i confronted her about it she told me the truth she actually ha around 20k credit card debt from purchasing luxury bag shoe clothes using 0 interest card i found this out summer of this year she hesitated telling me when everything went wrong with my business because she say she didn t want to burden me with more debt than i already had i appreciated her thought and i understood where she wa coming from but told her it wa still wrong to not let me know about it so here we were i put my family in a bad situation due to my business and she did same with cc debt i figured we re even now so i told her i would take care of the debt since i already had plan to pay off all the debt i had already i just added hers to my list and worked my way through it this year now her debt will be paid off march of next year and my debt will be paid off april or may next year or so i thought she quit her job because she missed one of her meeting and one the boss chewed her out the bos did get personally with scolding so i understand where my wife wa coming from the bos wa very unprofessional so her now unemployed we decided she should focus on the kid again a i wa slowly making my way to being debt le again but her spending got out of control again making big donation to our kid s school just to beat other class volunteering for the thanksgiving lunch at school by donating turkey lunch buying christmas tree for 350 and other decoration for total of 500 this month so while i m buying 35 shoe off of amazon with point i ve saved up she s out buying hermès sandal for 600 grocery trip average 200 a visit buying christmas decoration that last a month and are in our storage for 11 month going to starbucks every day i finally told her if she keep this up we can never pay off the debt i told her no more cc and that she can only use the money from 2 5k i give her a month if she need more she ll have to let me know so that s 1 issue i ve had this year but there s another i work 10 hour a day for 6 day a week my only day off is saturday every morning i wake up at 6 30 to shower and get ready so that i can cook setup breakfast for the kid pack lunch and get them ready for school day care my wife is asleep until she wake up at 8 10 and drive them to school i finish up getting ready and leave for work i ve always thought i m not helping i m being a parent to my kid they are my kid and it doesn t matter who cook or provide for them so after work i go home and we bathe the kid together and get the to bed together i eat dinner after the kid are asleep usually after 9pm then i clean the dish that wa piled up throughout the day and have maybe an hour or two free time then go to bed i don t mind i m just doing what dad are supposed to do i also understand she spends the day cleaning the house and getting the kid to afterschool activity and such making dinner and playing with them that s not easy to do but this weekend morning a usual i wa up early and wa using the restroom my 5yo woke up and wa looking for me so i quickly get out and make her breakfast when the 2yo came out a well i gave them an ipad to watch cartoon a they are only allowed on the weekend i get some coffee myself and sit down to rest a bit my wife wake up an hour an a half later yelling at the kid to stop watching ipads because it s enough so they stop and go upstairs to brush their teeth and i follow this is when my wife yell at me to clean up after myself when using the bathroom i asked her what i did and apparently i forgot to throw away the empty paper roll when i hurried out of the bathroom when my kid called me i kind of snapped and told her that i m sorry that i did that but it wa because i wa taking care of the kid while she wa asleep i simply forgot and meant to clean it up so don t yell at me when i m making breakfast in the morning so you can sleep a bit more she then say she s only sleeping because she want me to spend more time with the kid due to my work she saying i m not there for my kid and that s why our 2yo is more attached to her than me i admit our 2yo is more attached to her than me but i figured it wa because it wa that phase and he missed her a lot when she wa working for 8 month so that attachment got worse either way i told her that s a b excuse and that i know she can t wake up in the morning because she spends all night looking at her phone until 1am she keep yelling at me saying i m not a good father for the kid and i need to spend more time with them and that she s not a maid so i can clean up after myself at this point i just stopped talking because the kid were there i leave for a minute and went back to get ready for the day she keep belittling me saying under her breath like pathetic get out dirty so i packed my thing and told her i wanted to divorce she said ok and i tried to leave my 5 yo come asking where i m going and i told her that i m sorry but i have to go to work someone need daddy to work today she cry and asks if it s because mommy is mean i lost it there and cried and reassured her that no i just really need to go to work my wife run down screaming at the kid to let me go and that daddy is not coming home for awhile i m in the mindset of even if we fight we should never get the kid involved but i guess she feel different either way i leave after i reassure my kid that i will be back tonight the kid were supposed have their pic taken with santa that day so 3 of them went while i sat in wal mart parking lot for 7 hour thinking i finally went home because i missed my kid so much and her first word were pathetic and we ve been ignoring each other since i ve explained everything to her sister who recommends getting counseling but i think we re past that we tried that last year were good for about 6 month and she s back to her normal self my diagnosis last time were severe depression and anxiety i ve gotten a lot better now that my business a bit more stable now sorry for the very long text but i still have few more thing that happened before but i figure you guy don t want to read all of these so are we past that point to recovery and should i go through with the divorce or should we try counseling like her sister recommended tl dr wife is emotionally abusive and spends money without thinking should i divorce her even though i love my 2 kid to death,0

update i caught my 24f boyfriend 26m talking to findoms again and i finally left he never changed he never wanted to link to the original post i wasted another year of my life by trying to help a person that never helped themselves and i m paying for it in every way imaginable i introduced him to the r stopfindom subreddit we went to therapy three time only initiated when i caught him i tried avoiding it i tried confronting him nothing worked because he never stopped the cycle i wa going to study abroad in asia in december and i did not need this on my mind before i went so very impromptu on nov 16 i decided i could not be with him anymore i wa sick of feeling used and lied to about something that he didn t need to lie about i didn t have solid proof i just had it mentally because i felt he wa hiding something from me and he wasn t trying to fix our relationship at all even though he swears up and down he did instead of handling it well he show me an engagement ring his mom gave to him a i wa breaking up with him and begged me to stay again we didn t speak at all while i wa away and i wish it stayed that way i came back early january and our lease isn t up until february so i decided we could live together until then and it wa great until monday or at least i thought so anyway we were talking openly about our feeling and he kept apologizing for everything that went wrong he still wanted to be my friend hard no it wasn t until this last monday that he got a new phone and switched over his sim card to his new one while he wa at work his old phone kept going off so i looked at it i fully acknowledge that since we aren t together i had no right to go through his phone but the shit i found make me feel no guilt what so ever if anything i m proud i can see him for who he actually is i found out he went to see one of the doms he wa cheating on me with in la and never stopped talking to her even before we broke up and in 15k in debt from sending multiple doms money sn he always told me one of the trait he doesn t like about me is how badly i handle money har har projecting much after i saw this i puked packed a bag and left i texted him that i am leaving and unless it wa about the apartment i never wanted to hear from him again we ve been avoiding each other since i ve been slowly moving my thing out and putting it in storage and i just feel emotionally defeated i went through three month worth of message and found a few interesting thing other than the nude video and pretty subpar sexting he acknowledges that he lied and that he had an intimate connection with her to which she reply that s called deceit not cheating he s glad that it wa her glad that he can finally make someone happy glad he can please his goddess glad to be free upset that i never understood him wow what a goof lol he is so disillusioned and addicted to this lifestyle that he genuinely belief she care about him and that he s in the right he think she s actually his friend while she go out to dinner with her boyfriend with his money and using him for emotional support something he complained about to her about me and how he loved emotionally fucking with me she is being paid thousand of dollar to stroke their ego though so i think i would understand that you have to keep the customer happy she got 500 off of that la visit which is pretty impressive if you ask me i feel like i should say that i respect sex worker and everything they do a lot but this specific dom is manipulative and ha no boundary she is a half baked amateur at best who really ha no clue on how to even pretend to know what she s doing she give actual doms a bad name anyone who is a proper dom and actually cared about their sub well being would never do the shit that these two concocted like sending me a picture of her as and saying she only did it because he asked her to asking him how he s going to spoil me today and him telling her that he s going to take me to get my nail done a a surprise him telling her how unappreciative i am of his gift because they don t feel genuine which they weren t lol i never consented to any of this and this shit ha fucked me up for life but get this she s an advocate for mental wellness what a joke she praised him for getting out of a toxic relationship and wa glad he could be free from all of my nagging and that i wouldn t hold this over his head anymore again either she s really good at customer satisfaction or a really shitty person more than likely both but he never told her that i wa the one who actually ended the relationship but yeah never changed he talked a big game but is so deep into his addiction and himself that he s willing to risk everything for it i should have listened to everyone s advice and left when i had the chance i shouldn t have moved in with him instead i wa emotionally abused by a narcissist who felt that he did everything he could a direct quote he said to the findom he never stopped talking to for the past six month sorry if this look all over the place btw a happy a i am that i made the decision to leave i am super depressed and feel like i failed i know this is all his fault but i feel like i should have seen this coming that besides this one thing he wa amazing but it wa a lie reddit really helped me the last time and that s the only reason i m posting here because i haven t slept in the past three day and could really use some support and will probably regret posting this later lol amp x200b amp x200b tldr i left my lying findom addicted ex and while i m emotionally destroyed and angry i m glad i left send good vibe,0
i m 26f beginning to hate my husband 30m have any of you ever found someone just so difficult to love who also got worse over time that s what i m dealing with we ve been married for 2 year and i m officially emotionally drained there is not enough explaining to him how it would be beneficial to both of u if he wa considerate of me and how it ll help u to be a stronger team he blow up and becomes defensive no matter if it s me who is saying it or our marriage counselor it seems all he want from me is someone to sleep with and to make him feel better about himself over the course of our relationship he started drinking morning through night he is constantly drunk and extremely passive aggressive with any serious conversation or decision making i ask him if he want to talk or if he s happy and even scheduled an appointment with a doctor for him so he can talk to someone without me there but he doesn t try to seek help or check in with himself emotionally whenever we visit his family he s a completely different person and put on a whole act for them he all of a sudden want to listen to me and not interrupt when i m talking give me affirmation and what get me too is he suddenly becomes the guru of relationship he regurgitates word for word thing that i tell him that would help me in our relationship masquerading like he doe those thing when we leave his family he then turn into the dark annoying sarcastic devaluing cloud that i now avoid like the plague i just got back from a weekend vacation to a house that ha not been cleaned at all and liquor bottle during my trip he constantly tried arguing with me saying i don t care about how he feel but whenever i d ask how doe he feel because he doesn t use i feel statement and he also doesn t like for me to assume how he feel he would keep blowing up i would like to add the only reason i went on that trip is to get away from him because a week prior in a drunken rage after i asked him to not try to humiliate me in public after he thought he could get laugh from another guy by putting me down the guy didn t think he wa funny he had no apology or accountability he just became pissed when i asked him if he thought his cousin who he look up to try to humiliate his woman in public he followed my car drunk for 40 minute and kept trying to run me off the road the police seen him and he wa arrested and charged also to add to that he had the nerve to come home and tell me he doesn t want to be with me anymore because i didn t pick him up from the station and that i secretly want to be with his cousin the icing on the cake is he expected me to have sex with him last night first night back home and wa upset because i didn t want him touching me he wa drunk when he came home plus i just cleaned the house and hadn t gotten any rest i told him that i don t feel like i can trust him and i m emotionally distant because i m tired of trying in this relationship but before i could finish he cut me off which wa expected and went into me not caring about how he feel and i showed more love to my son cat instead of him tl dr i m ready to divorce my alcoholic inconsiderate husband of two year and would like advice from those who may have insight or experienced anything similar i apologize for the rant you guy,0
this guy pt 1 ,1
i need someone to validate that this wa fucked so i ve been doing super well in therapy but there s one thing i haven t been able to wrap my head around my ex would slap me in the face but never out of anger just like whenever he pleased to he acted like he wa a kid playing a game it wa more startling and humiliating than hurtful and whenever i d protest he d say no but you like it because i asked him to hit me during sex batterwd wife syndrome which he really also had no problem and he still did it even after i said consent is continuous he only stopped when i started actively flinching around him whenever he d raise his hand close to my face that s super wrong right,1
my 38m wife 42f is hiding two extra phone tldr wife ha 3 phone and is doing something secret with them we ve been together over 10 year and she wa my first gf she ha been in many relationship from the very start she ha a spending problem with thousand of dollar of debt it would be stupid purchase of thing that are completely unnecessary like movie trinket that you don t want to own after 2 year or ordering thing from overseas were you pay 100 shipping on a 50 item that ha been inflated to 100 and that is something that we have dealt with every couple of year since then by that i mean every couple of year i found out she ha a new credit card and ha over 10 000 on it that she can t pay off at the very start we got rid of all her card and gave her a supplementary card on my account she wa supposed to use cash and my card for anything that need a card but the bank would send her an offer and she would apply for the card she rack up to the limit within a year she would be paying the over limit fee every month and paying the minimum amount i would pay it off she would cut up the card and she would promise never to do it again anyway we have a child now and i guess it keep going every few year and of course we have no saving but we are managing to scrape by she work part time i work on my own business at home and it s probably fine a long a she doesn t do anything weird she ha an android phone a couple of year old flagship it work fine except she want to play pokego on it and it keep draining the battery and crashing she mention should she get a new phone when she saw this special 200 one and i told her that soon is actually slower than her even though it s newer so she would keep playing on her phone and she would have three or 4 battery pack with her i would ask her why in the one hour it take her to get to work she could possibly drain the phone battery and a battery pack from playing game so anyway one day i found she ha another phone she hid it in behind some of her stuff in an area of the house i don t usually use it s a model from this year i looked around a bit more and then she actually had another phone in her work bag a model from late last year 1 i could explain i saying maybe it s from work but two extra phone is a bit weird not sure of the model exactly but from what i can see they are about 300 500usd each i kept a watch for the next few day and she take both of those phone out whenever she s out of the house of course when she go to work and even going grocery shopping or when she say i m going for a stroll pretty sure she s doing this to make sure i never find them so maybe she s doing the pokemon while she s out for a walk but she s holding 3 phone at this point i m kind of stumped what the purpose of this is all phone have a sim card in them she keep the other two powered off when she s at home and i don t really know anything else about them now she s obviously got another new credit card because she ha to pay for the phone plan not to mention buy the phone i m really not sure what to do at this point i mean i probably should have left the 2nd or 3rd time she lied to me confronting her without any proof is useless because she is a fluent liar she can and will spin a story on anything you talk to her about without pausing without blinking,0

my m23 girlfriend f21 of 6 month said something that ha really bothered me i m currently a medical student i come from a lower middle class background having the opportunity to become a doctor ha honestly been a privilege i walked into medical school thinking that i d really love to do something like surgery or a sub specialty within recently my girlfriend and i were eating dinner somewhere and i mentioned that i ve started to like other field like internal medicine and family medicine that seem to not be a popular i wa talking about how i love talking to patient and working through their problem my girlfriend told me at that moment if i didn t do a surgical specialty she probably wouldn t see a future with me now i m not sure if i want to switch my goal currently even tbh i still really really want to do surgery but red flag went up everywhere in my brain she s not in medicine so her basis wasn t something more legitimate not sure if there even is some legitimate reason for her response to me she told me that surgeon earn more money and were more respected she said that if i wa going to do family medicine she could have just gone back to dating other business student she s a business student i tried to look at thing in her perspective she come from a much wealthier family than i do so in some way i can see how she want a certain standard of life and she s right in some sense that family medicine or some other primary care discipline would earn more but i couldn t help shake the thought that she s just with me because i have the potential to be wealthy and be respected to talk about me at party to amplify herself and that s worrisome i m concerned if this is a legitimate reason to end the relationship if i decide to shift my practice to family medicine i should be able to being a doctor is my goal dream and i should be supported completely by those that say they love me this whole thing happened a few day ago and we haven t really talked about it since then because i have been struggling to marshal an appropriate response but how should i even broach this conversation with her any suggestion i m also annoyed that we didn t talk about this earlier in some way i feel like i ve invested too much into this relationship i know this is a sunk cost fallacy but a 6 month relationship ending because of a red flag noticed later i m just not sure i m frustrated sad and quite frankly feeling like my goal aren t supported tl dr gf say shes with me bc i have career potential after i indicate the possibility of changing my mind for my goal help,0

may not be the the exact same abuse that most of your guy are going through but it ha to fall into some type of abusive category i feel so hopeless i know i have posted here a good bit amp sometimes it s similar issue or concern but with it being so close to christmas we don t have the money for me to see my therapist and i am in desperate need of advice please don t be extremely harsh and judgmental at the idea that i am even asking these thing but maybe i do need a slap back to reality my husband 32m amp i 27f have had a rough 2 year been together 9 year total up until i walked in on him masturbating in bed watching porn amp found out he wa secretly paying for premium subscription through paypal in november 2017 he kept his addiction from me amp would go to any length to hide deny amp lie about him watching it but it became obvious when he began to quit showing much affection and interest in me or anything outside of work amp experienced ed issue for 2 3 month he quit watching porn amp quit masturbating but it wa short lived not long after that he discovered the wife pic sharing group on here amp began posting ad of me asking to trade pic vids of me u in exchange for other men s picture amp video of their gfs wife he created an email a kik amp snapchat account that i didn t know about to trade with all of these men couple mostly men who i assume were also doing it behind their girl back amp they talked dirty about our body amp talked about how they would love to trade for an hour or two the weird part is when he did talk to couple he would even pretend i wa apart of it amp a part of the conversation because he knew it would be creepy if he wa doing it alone amp most couple won t share stuff unless it s the couple together so for almost 4 month march june 2018 he wa doing this a a way to get his fix amp wa masturbating to these picture amp video which explained why yet again when i would initiate intimacy he would have a hard time getting staying erect being the fact i am a stay at home mom amp we have two little girl i decided to give him the chance again to get help and get better for himself amp his family i think he ha been to 4 5 saa meeting amp we went to a therapist a few time he did a lot of reading amp research on porn sex addiction for a while but nothing stuck thing have gotten better a most thing do with time i suppose but the issue is that he amp i both being sexual individual find excitement amp fun in talking about sexual fantasy amp thing we would like to try together he ha been more open with me amp i have with him too i actually came out to being bi curious not long after everything blew up a mistake i guess he ha expressed that he never want to go back to doing thing alone again amp hiding thing that he enjoys u sharing everything sexually amp want to only explore thing with me he constantly fantasizes about seeing me with another woman amp actually made an account on a site where you can meet amp chat with local swinger amp unicorn to find a third of whatever he say he isn t interested in being sexual amp touching the other woman amp only want to watch or mess with me during whatever but after knowing what he talked about he say he only said those thing because he knew it wa never going to actually happen i can t help i feel that he may be trying to slowly push me into the whole swinger thing or something to benefit him maybe to get the same high experience we were going to new orleans for our anniversary amp he signed u up to attend a swinger club while we were there the other thing is the site that he made our profile on ha a lot of x rated picture video i have told him that i am worried that these are not at all thing someone trying to recover should be doing or looking at that i am afraid he is just finding another way to get that rush amp to be honest it doe suck because i would probably be open amp excited about venturing out amp exploring ourselves together but after all he put me through it s rough on me past traumatic experience amp all knowing how much he lied before so there s lack of trust what doe this look like to you is it obvious i just don t want to play with fire amp get burned,1

my 26f boyfriend 26m of 4 year spent christmas with my family for the first time and now i m thinking of ending thing this is a throwaway account my boyfriend of 4 year and his grandmother spent christmas eve and day with my family this year though my family is welcoming for the most part my dad and younger sister aren t huge fan of my boyfriend in their word they think i can do better this ha caused some underlying tension between my boyfriend and sister in particular around this time last year my sister and boyfriend had a huge fight about the way he spoke to me she doesn t see bf much a we live in different city but in her perspective this wa an opportunity for him to show her how he s grown a chance to smooth thing over for the better needle to say my boyfriend s behaviour wa downright disappointing for both of u this christmas throughout the past two day he s continuously made comment about how i m acting how i need to pay more attention to him how i keep talking back etc for example he told me to watch my mouth when we were out for a beer with the whole family which took people aback i wa mortified he also tends to poke fun at me but the joke just aren t funny they can be downright hurtful he make fun of my interest my weight where i d like to go on vacation my entire family ha told me they don t like how he speaks to me i think i m more cognizant of it when i m around them but looking back at my journal over the past year i ve written more negative entry about him and how he make me feel than positive when i ve tried to approach him about this issue he act extremely defensive and put the blame either on my family or me he act like a spoiled brat never claiming responsibility or acknowledging the fact that he could be in the wrong i m considering speaking to his grandmother and asking for her advice a she basically raised him and ha dealt with his various mood and tone he ha a lot of family problem which i think have contributed to how he act around my family but this is speculation this coupled with some other issue such a me just finding out he wa suspended from his job he told me he had vacation time are making me seriously question how much longer i can take this i m embarrassed by his behaviour and lack of accountability for his action we live together and most of the time are pretty happy or so i thought it s when we re around other people that he act the fool and make me feel like i constantly have to apologize for being me or simply existing thinking if i should dodge a bullet while i m still somewhat young and end it or consider therapy i love him and thought he had the potential to improve but now i m not so sure tldr my boyfriend is rude to me in front of my family and tends to tear me down he also lied about being suspended from a job should i stay or go,0

soul mate we had a kid this summer that ha thrown some natural wrench into the mix but nothing we haven t been able to quickly work through with solid communication and team work i d say most people that know u deem our relationship to be one of the best they know of for some relatively unimportant reason from my past trust is the aspect of a relationship that matter most to me which is something she is aware of we make a huge effort to always be sometimes brutally honest with each other which ha helped our relationship immensely the downside to this is mistrust trigger me so i can tend to exaggerate problem around this subject because it is so important to me my wife is incredibly good at her job a a tech recruiter a year ago she wa recruited to work for a better company than the one she had been at previously for 1 5 year which is the company where the issue occurred at the previous company she made some really quick immediate impact and began blowing all of her metric out of the water and making some noise that garnered her national attention a the company had outpost in almost every city her area vp quickly took notice of her effort and success and began giving her attention that wasn t unwarranted for context a the area vp he wa 4 level of management above her and oversaw a fourth of the u office about 20 so getting this kind of attention wa a huge boost to my wife s confidence her number backed up the attention a well and pretty soon he wa seeking out her advice on recruiting tactic having her give demonstration on area conference call and skype meeting etc he wa visiting her office fairly regularly and they were having in depth conversation over lunch and im she wa pretty forthcoming about all of this and i wa stoked for her my wife ha a few male friend that i ve never taken issue with i ve never had a jealousy situation with her we are pretty good about maintaining fair boundary but this situation became a bit different while i never suspected my wife of cheating i did question his motivation particularly after a few situation that i saw a becoming borderline problematic he had begun inviting her to visit other office and fly to conference where they spent time drinking together one night he insisted that he drive her back to her hotel despite her saying she could get an uber and having a daily stipend that covered this he wa away from his wife and two kid under 2 3 week out of the month which wa a red flag for me and she remarked several time about how he demonstrated a hint of resentment when they discussed them finally he took her and a few coworkers out to a work dinner my wife called me to pick her up much later than i thought she would be and when i arrived she wa fairly tipsy and apparently all her coworkers had left two hour previous and they had stayed behind to finish the bottle of wine my spidey sens are going off like crazy at this point but i don t bring it up she left the company a few week later yesterday almost 13 month later i had a random thought about the situation and began stewing over it when i got home i get home one hour earlier than her due to commute time i realized she had left her phone at the house and i did that awful thing that s embarrassing a fuck i looked through her message i just wanted to read through their message history to see if there wa any indication that my gut feeling he had ulterior motif wa correct the message history and his contact card were deleted on top of this i found two separate message thread with her previous coworkers one claimed that her and this vp had been getting really close over the last few month and the other claimed that her and her area vp had been messaging super frequently which wa weird at this point i felt pretty sick and anxious and she got home she could tell something wa up and wouldn t drop it and when she picked up her phone she could tell i had been on it she called me out and i told her about how i had been feeling and that i felt stupid but it had been bothering me for a long time and i wa more curious if he ever made her feel uncomfortable she wa pretty adamant that nothing happened and that while maybe he had ulterior motif he never crossed any boundary and i wasn t right to be jealous she said she didn t know why the message were deleted and that nothing ever happened that wa inappropriate she said that if she wa ever in a situation like that she would have let me know immediately she wa fairly calm about it and so i dropped it told her i wa sorry and that i trusted her and that i wouldn t snoop like that again and it wa settled until later that night a we are laying in bed and she begun to get mad at me for snooping and rebrought everything back up what unfolded over the next two hour wa a massive blow out argument where she admitted that there wa way more to this than she had let on she told me that she knew he wa into her and attracted to her she told me that she liked the flattery and the praise and at time flirted back and reciprocated it she sought it out and didn t shy away from it she told me that she wa attracted to him and had some minor feeling for him but nothing she would risk our relationship on she told me that there were several weird moment with him like the car ride home or wine night where she felt like he wa putting off a vibe and she didn t know how to handle it but that she didn t necessarily not like it she said she didn t tell me for many reason one of which wa that she didn t necessarily want it to stop she said that she deleted the text message on purpose to cover her evidence so i wouldn t find it because there were some message that could be construed a inappropriate on top of all of this she said that the whole situation wa extremely confusing for her to navigate given the power dynamic and that she never would have cheated on me so now to me typing this out this morning i m extremely confused about how to handle this she didn t cheat on me i might be naive here but she certainly did lie she lied by omission over a long period of time covered her track had what i deemed to be an inappropriate relationship with this dude lied directly to my face about it last night upon being confronted then finally came clean amp x200b tl dr wife admitted she had what i deem to be an emotionally inappropriate relationship and hid it from me what next,0

two year ago my f25 uncle m 50 called me two day after christmas to tell me to leave my boyfriend m 25 of 5 year this christmas we are going together again how can i improve on the previous year so we can get on with our life tl dr how do i support my partner to the fullest at my family christmas when previously my extended family told me to break up with him ftp sorry for mobile formatting thank you for reading any part of this huge rant for context for christmas my mom and i travel 600 mile to my uncle house her brother for christmas celebration all the kid of the family are now adult in our twenty my family is pretty laid back or so i thought my boyfriend matt and i have been together for 5 year he ha worked with me through so much of my anxiety and support me in everything that i want to do he is forever patient and always hears me out he is a very quirky person huge nerd hate bully and people using their age or title a a mean of being better than others and abusing it when i first met him he came off a very confident but also very optimistic and innocent clueless some people think he is just fool hardy or a salesman type he is self confidence with a great family safety net which feel like the polar opposite of mine my mom interprets him a arrogant and trying to be better than her in our relationship he ha again and again backed me up and instilled a powerful amount of self worth in me that i didn t have before such a since he deserves the best i do too and more we share our expense like many couple these day during the call my uncle told me i should break up with him because he wa a slob his rudeness to the family and that he wa probably just trying to use me to take my money i don t have a huge sum of money am pretty poor my mom matt and myself drove up from our city it usually take u about 6 hour when we arrived matt gave my uncle a gift basket with wine and sweet all seemed to go well and we got settled for the holiday the plan wa to drive there stay the night for two day then drive back the first night when we were having dinner my uncle brought out a bottle of tequila and insisted that we take a shot together fist mistake matt and i were a little uncomfortable not big drinker and tired from the trip so to keep the peace we took a shot then said we were good although my uncle kept insisting our family doe a gift exchange game every year the one where you have a huge pile of gift and pick a number then everyone puck a gift in that order matt asked if he could just watch he didn t bring a gift for it and we were going to play together a a couple since we don t need two useless item we weren t planning on buying anyway my uncle pressured him to take a number wouldn t take no for an answer second mistake during the holiday gift exchange someone opened up a gift and it wa matt s house warming gift to my uncle you could see that it wa obviously tampered with and had a whole carton of cigarette added we were both very confused but kept it to ourselves a to not interrupt the game i found out later that my mom and my uncle took it to make a gift targeted for my grandmother they either forgot to let u in on the plan or didn t care since we are younger matt really disapproves of smoking but after the explanation wa chill at the end of the gift exchange there wa a spare gift floating around i went over to grab it so i could hand it back to whomever brought it the family egged me into opening it and it had wine stopper and gift card inside wrapped by my older cousin i tried to return them but after saying we should keep them matt told me i tried and it fine this wa another mistake for after i got back home i received a screaming cry call from my cousin mother saying matt is trying to steal money from our family and that he treat me like a wife of a taliban man o o wow the morning after we are having breakfast then leaving matt made himself a plate if leftover and wa standing next to the table eating with his hand last big mistake honestly he is not a morning person and chose to be quick instead of smart and forgot table manner but this really pissed my uncle off but instead of saying something he just kept it to himself which is fair except that he kept bringing this up in his call to me my grandmother adores my boyfriend she is getting older and is forgetting word but always asks me if i am happy and how my husband is doing and if he is taking care of me she pulled me aside at christmas and told me how much she loved that he wa always the first to jump up and offer help and look after people two day after is when my uncle called me he told me that if my dad wa alive he would beat the shit out of matt for how he treat me my dad passed when i wa 6 he pointed out the instance i wrote about above then i started cry and he said i shouldn t cry and that he didn t want to upset me then asked if i talk to no one about the call trying to swear me to secrecy i wa very upset for a long time afterwords i didn t go to our family following thanksgiving so my mom begged me to go to christmas i went just my mom and i and my uncle apologised kind of so i let go of my anger i love this person this relationship ha made me the happiest i ve ever been in my life his family is also incredible and they seem to really like me his mom and i have a lot in common and like to paint together on the weekend his dad last week told me how great matt and i are both doing for our age his mom keep telling me about her favorite jeweler of hers and his uncle always tell u how great we are with his kid i feel so bad for not being able to add to matt s life like he doe to mine i ve told him this too and all he say is that these event give him determination to do better in life and he laugh it all off matt asked if we could try again this year at christmas and try to get a better outcome he know that christmas really bothered me i want to know what we can do my mom assures me that it will be different this christmas and we can all enjoy each others company i m becoming more nervous a christmas week approach i don t approve of how my family go about thing matt want to try to reconnect so i

my 24f boyfriend 24m constantly try to prove that he is smarter than me in our argument my boyfriend and i have been together for around 6 year now he ha always been good with debating he know how to argue well and to his benefit he is incredibly smart and well spoken to the point of arrogance in some case i am not very good at debating i get passionate and excited and stumble on my word i am not dumb it s just harder for me to put my thought into sentence when we have opposing viewpoint on thing usually harmless thing like today it wa the ethic in american pop industry v the korean pop industry our argument can turn from friendly discussion to emotional blowout pretty quickly i feel like he is very focused on catching me in a logical fallacy and winning the argument rather than having a discussion i feel like our conversation are competition to see who is right and who is wrong rather than just discussing once he begin getting upset he begin to use bigger word and debate jargon that i am not familiar with and then get angry with me when i have problem understanding his logical fallacy flag and get frustrated with me when i ask him to explain them like i am just playing dumb he begin to treat me like a child like i am too slow to understand what he is saying it usually just end with me being too flustered or beaten down to continue the argument and i throw in the white flag calling him right this never seems to satisfy him either and frustrates him that i am giving up rather than continuing the fight for example the last thing he said to me today way you have degree from a liberal art institution so excuse me for assuming you paid any attention for your four and a half year don t pretend that me getting heated prevents you from making argument when you d rather stick to whataboutism and bad faith logic rather than learn how to actually make a good argument i feel like he sometimes try to turn are discussion into moment to teach me how to argue rather than just having a friendly conversation and when his tactic to educate me don t work because they come from a place of annoyance and anger rather than a genuine want to make me a better arguer he get angry when i point out that he treat me like a child sometimes or that he talk to me like i am dumb he say thing like well don t argue like a child like you re dumb or i am smarter than you we both know it amp x200b i don t really know what to do he is really smart but it hurt to hear him point it out like he is so above me i have a better job a degree while he couldn t finish school i am not doing bad in life or anything i feel like our argument turn so heated because i am not up to par with him and that anger him for some reason i am really tired of being treated like a child or like i am unintelligent and i don t know how to shrink his ego to see that amp x200b tldr my very smart boyfriend like to turn are harmless argument into heated debate and get mad when i am not up to par with his intellect but would rather get mad than educate me,0

why i am finally leaving about me 26f and my husband 36m i ve been hesitating to share this but reddit ha been so incredibly helpful over the last couple of year helping me see the red flag that i wa denying in my relationship so i m hoping this could encourage someone else to finally have the strength to leave what is a toxic dangerous and or abusive relationship anyway here ya go the tear have finally started to come after a week of just plowing through and figuring out logistics and telling myself that you didn t mean to cause all of that pain that you have suffered too and you re not a bad person and i shouldn t have let you do those thing to me but now all of those repressed memory are rising to the surface and i m struggling to keep them down just 3 and 1 2 hour before it s my birthday and i should be celebrating not cry but instead i m remembering and it hurt like hell and i can t stop remembering so instead i m writing and even though you re not a bad or evil person even though you have your own traumatic past it doesn t justify the abuse it doesn t justify anything so please listen and remember you want to know why i packed my stuff and left our apartment after 3 plus year of being in a relationship 1 of them married well here you go remember when i wa driving to your apartment and you wanted to start a fight with a woman who wa going out the wrong way of the complex and i suggested we just go in the other entrance asking you not to worry about it since i wa the one driving and it really wasn t any of your business and you blew up at me screamed that i wa taking her side and locked me out of the apartment while i stood there sobbing and pounding on the door begging you to let me in apologizing and humiliating myself in an attempt to gain back your love and trust and affection remember when i told you i wa going to hang out with some friend after my dance class at the university not even a year after we started dating and when i got home you lectured me on how i didn t give you my exact location and how you were upset about this and how did you know i wasn t out fucking some other guy or getting raped in an alley remember how i apologized not knowing then that i didn t need to apologize for a damn thing remember when you returned home from fighting wildfire and brought me a beautiful little plant i fucking loved that plant and then when i told i had dared to send a text to your roommate to figure out when and how to return a key to your apartment you screamed at me told me to pull over threw the whole plant out the window and proceeded to verbally attack me for hour accusing me of fucking your friend accusing me of lying to you accusing me of going behind your back accused me of a million thing and i sat in my car shaking from head to toe feeling like i wa going crazy trying not to have a panic attack trying to pull myself together remember how you saw that my underwear wa inside out and you asked suspiciously did you take that off at work it wasn t inside out this morning again inferring that i wa fucking my coworker behind your back though you had zero evidence to support this my constant faithfulness and transparency didn t mean anything to you didn t convince you that i wasn t just a filthy slut remember how you said that you would never homeschool my child because i wa homeschooled and look how i turned out socially awkward shy unsure of myself god forbid they be a fucked up a me right you knew what my insecurity were and you knew how to use them against me a a deadly weapon remember how some of your biggest pet peeve where when people disobeyed you or questioned you and how you would get what seemed to me irrationally angry when you saw character in a fucking movie do this ranting about how they were disrespectful and stupid and need to just do what they re told in hindsight that should have been a major red flag people were your best friend until they dared to question your judgement or disobey a direct order then you would cut them out of your life without hesitation remember how we were at a new year s eve party and when one man started talking to me and making slightly suggestive comment you pulled me aside and criticized me for not telling him to stop said that if i wa a real feminist and if i respected you a a partner then i would have done something about it even though i had been ignoring him and not doing anything in the realm of flirting even though it wa your friend s party not mine and i didn t know anybody there even though you had been standing right beside me and didn t say a damn thing not that i expected you to but why wa i to blame a always remember how mad and enraged and irritated you got at me about every single thing burping at the table serving you food that wasn t warm enough wearing a dirty and torn up shirt not wearing enough lingerie for you sending you nude that weren t good enough having my own opinion disagreeing with you being shy being introverted being a feminist me sleeping on the same side of the bed every night which apparently made your arm go numb from spooning me with the same arm every night even though i had no fucking clue this wa a problem for you i kid you not this wa a genuine cause of a blow up argument that lasted for two hour remember how i wa off at a summer dance intensive and you kept calling me expecting to fix all of your problem from towing the car you were driving to transferring money to our bank account and then getting really pissed when i failed to take care of these issue even though i wa on the other side of the u and wa busy all day dancing and taking class you did pay for that intensive and i am grateful for that however i m not grateful for how you threw that fact in my face for how you paid for something you knew i loved and then did everything in your power to ruin it for me is that really support remember when you went to another state for your job and expected me to do the work of finding you an apartment even though you had specifically told me that you were going to find a place with your friend you insisted it wa because of your immigration status in the this country but looking back i think now that you just wanted me to be your errand girl to be your everything to be with you 24 7 because otherwise you couldn t cope with the loneliness and low self esteem here s a head up y all that isn t love that s codependency that s toxic that s deadly remember how we would go hiking and you would throw a fit when i didn t take good picture of you i tried i really tried but if the angle wasn t right or i didn t frame it just so you would get irritated and ask why can t you just take a good picture what s so hard about it then proceed to sulk for hour afterward ruining an otherwise lovely experience remember how i got pregnant and you blamed me for failing to be on birth control even though you were the one who didn t want to use condom anymore which i agreed to but we knew the risk involved and we both had responsibility for this slip up and i thought this responsibility should be shared 50 50 but i know you always blamed me and god know it hurt so badly it stuck like a knife in my heart a mere 12 hour before i got my abortion you were yelling at me for this so focused on your own feeling that you forgot about mine saying that if i had just sucked it up and taken the pill we wouldn t be in this situation i ve never felt so lonely and scared and confused in my life you did support me during the procedure holding my hand through the nauseating and excruciating pain but the whole incident still make me feel queasy when i think back on it remember how you always criticized and bad mouthed everyone in my family my dad wa too conservative my mom wa a failure and a dumb starbucks drinking yoga mom my grandparent were uber republican they were conservative sure and i don t always agree with them but what right did you have to trash talk them when your own brother is a fairly conservative christian my sibling apparently hated u and didn t support u because they couldn t make it to our wedding which wa a last minute decision and they had very important work school commitment but apparently that didn t matter my family made every effort to support u and to include you in our family but you still tried to turn me against them remember how you made strange comment about my body that always seemed a little off saying how you loved my body how it looked when we first met and how oh you used to have such big breast that s part of what attracted me to you and bemoaning the fact that i d lost weight when it wa the stress of our rocky relationship that caused the weight loss in the first place or when you tried to micromanage the way i ate saying thing like don t eat so much bread maybe that s why you re always bloated and don t have a six pack knowing damn well i had an eating disorder for four year and wa super sensitive to people telling me how to eat remember how you would pick fight with me 24 7 make me feel shitty then take me to your brother s house and yell at me because i wasn t happy or engaged or enthusiastic during the visit telling me i didn t care about your family and asking why wa i always upset when we went to visit them gee i wonder why remember how you dragged me out of the car one night staring stony faced a i sobbed and told you to stop over and over again and how you begged for my forgiveness afterward i should have known it wa only going to get worse god i wa so naive remember how you called me a dumb bitch a useless wife a stupid selfish white girl a piece of shit human being guess what that whole stick and stone rhyme is bullshit word do hurt and i thought it wa ok for you to use those word because oh he wa upset oh he just can t control his anger oh he didn t mean it but you were a 35 year old adult and i gave you a thousand chance to prove that you didn t mean it remember how i went to a dance off at a local bar and when i texted you saying it wa lasting longer then expected you said i ve never heard of a dance off going for four hour text me a selfie right now to prove where you are this wasn t the first time you d had me prove my location to you your constant suspicion and paranoia gave me almost constant anxiety and made me not want to go out and do anything on my own remember how in the most recent incident you physically forced the car key from my hand threatened to destroy my car called me a bitch and left to go to work knowing damn well i had to use the car to get to my job that afternoon working a a psw caring for a boy with autism which wa 10 mile away whereas it wa a 10 minute walk to your job so i had to walk around for two hour in the freezing cold until i found a rental car then you brought the car home during your lunch break and insisted i never threatened to destroy it i never said that sure but it wa too late i lost my trust in you and because you put my job in jeopardy i packed my stuff and left i will remember the good time too of course i will a they all say if it wa bad all the time we would leave a hell of a lot sooner and i wa far from perfect myself i made mistake i didn t communicate well i didn t set boundary i wa awkward and sometimes emotionally distant i wa hesitant to step outside my comfort zone and had major anxiety problem it wa my first relationship ever my first sexual experience and i had a lot to learn but i ve realized it s not my job to fix you it s not my job to be your counselor and your therapist i want the best for you but i cannot stand beside you while you treat me this way it hurt and i will miss you i will be grateful for everything you taught me and shared with me still i have to do what s best for my health and sanity i don t trust you anymore and part of me wonder if your love for me wa ever legitimate or if you just loved me because of what i could do for you i am 26 year old and i have my whole life ahead of me so here s to new beginning,1

my 23f attitude to having child ha changed in the last year or so struggling and wondering if i want them to have them biologically boyfriend 20m definitely want kid me and my boyfriend have been together for a year from the very start of our relationship we discussed what we envisioned for our future marriage child etc my boyfriend ha always wanted child more than one maybe three at most i too wa always on board with child ever since i wa a teen i felt that i d love to have four kid and in an ideal world i d have two boy and two girl i expressed this to my boyfriend and he said he d like that too i also stated i d like to have maybe two child biologically but that i d also love to adopt at some point however in the last year year and a half maybe i ve been having conflicting thought about child it s important to note i fell pregnant by accident in the summer and got an abortion i have always said that if i got pregnant at a stage in life where i m not ready not financially stable not prepared mentally or emotionally etc i would abort i had no emotional attachment to the pregnancy it felt like a parasite to me and i wanted rid of it asap but my feeling on pregnancy and parenthood have been changing since before this event i think the whole thing just spurred them on particularly because i hated how out of sort i felt for the whole pregnancy anyway i m just feeling like maybe i only wanted child a a teen because that s what society expects of woman i liked picturing the aesthetic of a big family and cute baby but the reality is it would be really hard and i honestly don t know if i have the mental capacity to be a parent i have depression anxiety and adhd and my mother suffered horribly from post partum depression too and i m worried about that affecting me on top of what i already deal with i find it incredibly difficult to function on little sleep a i m sure most people do but i think it s heightened in my case i don t want to be a miserable tired grumpy person after child that s not fair on the kid or anyone i don t like the idea of the lack of freedom of giving up much of my own life personality career of completely changing my body of worrying about money of the potential danger of giving birth i m just terrified i m going to have child and completely resent them regret it but i also think i would regret not having them once i m old my mother ha five sibling who are all fairly close and all of them bar one have partner and at least two kid and i love being a part of a big family the gathering are often the highlight of my year so part of me think i would love to create continue that atmosphere myself i do think that maybe if i leave it alone the feeling of wanting them being ready will just come to me someday but then what if that doesn t happen i just have such a negative view of parenthood and i don t know how to change that it s not like i don t have experience with kid either i ve been the primary babysitter for two of my youngest cousin for year they are sibling eldest is six youngest is three i started taking care of the eldest on a regular basis when she wa about three month old and have cared for her and her sister after she came along ever since we have a very close bond and i adore them but i admit i find child aged around four to eight very difficult i love spending time with them but i hate having to participate in their admittedly very boring pretend game and act interested i realise that sound horrible and i never show my dislike for this activity i participate a eagerly a possible and play with them for age but it doe occur to me that that would be a huge part of motherhood pretending to be interested in the boring thing and participating in activity that the kid love but that i hate for their sake i often babysit them overnight for a couple of day if their parent go to a gig or have a night away for a birthday or whatever and i also find the daily evening routine of dinner play bath brush teeth storytime bedtime so tedious it s fine because i don t need to do it every day but if i had kid i would i know a huge and hard part of parenthood is how boring the routine can be especially for stay at home parent and the idea of doing it is so unappealing i try to think of how your love for your child equal so much more than the hard part but i just cannot imagine wanting to lose myself in that even for the unconditional love of a child i m not sure why i m so plagued by these worry all of a sudden i think it s because i wa always so certain i wanted child and now i just don t know i ve spoken to my boyfriend about these worry and he say not to stress about them now and that we can basically cross that bridge when we come to it we agreed neither of u want kid for probably another decade but i don t like that approach i feel like that creates a ted and robin from himym situation ted wanted kid robin did not but they ignored that because they loved each other and ultimately it ended in a painful break up because they wanted completely different thing i don t want to build an entire life with someone only to discover ten year down the line that i truly don t want child and he still 100 doe breaking up after all that time would be horrific part of me think it would be easier if i were a man i could have kid but not worry about it altering my body or brain chemistry not to say it still wouldn t be hard but the physical aspect is not appealing there s also a lot le societal pressure on men to become parent but also still have a successful career etc etc it just feel like the grass is greener in that sense if i were a guy i probably would be feeling a lot le stress to come to a decision about it i just don t really know how to approach these thought or if i should talk more with my boyfriend about it it s very much a personal problem but one that will affect my boyfriend if i have child with him and regret it or end up deciding i never want them am i fretting over nothing should i really just try to banish the thought from my mind for now the worry come to me on a regular basis and i hate spending my time stressing about it when it s not an immediate issue like i said i wouldn t even want to have kid for another ten year so worrying about it all the time now leaf me feeling like i m being ridiculous and wasting my time i just feel at a loss how are you supposed to figure it out for sure sorry for the ramble thanks for reading if you did tl dr boyfriend and i together for one year he definitely want kid in the future and i thought i did too but over the last year or two my feeling on parenthood have changed i have a very negative view of it but feel i may also regret not having child i don t really know what to do how are you supposed to figure it out for sure,0

and now for some transparency or why notallmen will not be allowed on this sub free and open debate welcome i have been having an issue with moderation for a while namely how to deal with including a many people a possible while leaving out the more toxic movement in the reddit platform i am not a perfect person and i should mention i am doing this without consulting any other mod i have been having behind the scene debate on modmail pm s other sub other platform and irl with friend notallmen is not allowed on this sub if you don t like it go somewhere else i will paraphrase a message i recently sent to a user to explain my exact reason in the comment below any user is welcome to debate any position a long a you do not attack other commenters with slur make threat and keep in mind the real point of this sub is to allow victim and survivor a place to speak freely and get whatever support is available this wa my reply to a male abuse victim angry about my decision a a mod gt i m honestly fed the fuck up with the notallmen bullshit i don t care about that on this sub this sub is for victim and survivor to vent about their abuser and not for people to derail a person s rant or experience i allow bad language just not personal attack between user healing can be full of a lot of darkness gt notallmen is bullshit no man post here about his female abuser and ha to deal with the notallwomen troll when a man speaks about his abuse at the hand of a woman he never ha to deal with that gt woman and victim know that not all men are abuser this is a condescending party line from angry men and is the equivalent of you talking about your car or driving in general and having everyone parrot car need gasoline gt thank you captain obvious gt we are already very aware that not all men are abusive shit we all have men in our life that we respect and admire at least i hope we all do when i am speaking about my experience with abuse i do not mention all the men that didn t beat me and terrorize me because that would be pointless so please stop with that bullshit gt i understand your abuser wa female i have no doubt in your experience what i doubt is your understanding of most form of abuse particularly romantic relationship abuse which is pretty common although i have noticed most victim who talk about childhood were also abused by parental figure so if you are a victim of abuse it is almost always a partner or parent gt obviously if you are speaking about being abused by a partner then if you are insert attraction orientation your abuser will be whatever gender you prefer to have a relationship with we have plenty of same sex couple victim that have posted here i won t make people tone down a post and i won t make people have to justify their experience with insert gender because it hurt your feel and this go both way they are speaking about personal lived experience and if it make you uncomfortable i suggest you eat more calcium and grow yourself a shell sidenote here i wa pretty angry gt the conversation here should be abuse bad not but not all men abuse it infuriates me because you derail the conversation and everyone rush to make sure you aren t offended and the victim op is steamrolled and doesn t get the support they asked for if you want to speak about your abuse by whatever gender then go for it we already have a statistically large percentage of abused men and i take that a a sign i am doing something good gt make your own post don t co op someone else s pain don t make it their post about you share your story this is how woman support each other they don t ask unnecessary question they just offer empathy by sharing their own experience or they offer sympathy with platitude sidenote here i misused that word it wa late and i had a long day and i couldn t think of what to call the help number and website link that are often posted either way it make everyone feel better so try it some time gt i do have some bias i have spent a lot of time on controversial sub reading and sometimes arguing various point i don t think you can say an entire gender is bad i have tried to be balanced in my leaning i am pretty far left though i don t want this to become one of those picky sub where we all have to watch our pronoun use for fear of offense if i am pouring out my pain which i have done a lot of then i don t need a notallmen sorry if reality injured you all my abuser have been male almost all female victim have male abuser i shouldn t have to justify my right to feel pain at my abuse no victim should gt and this is where my bias lay it is not all men but it s a lot it s enough that we can call it an epidemic it s particularly prevalent and toxic on reddit even with the wave of sub ban i don t think those agenda help victim or survivor i have seen sub after sub consumed by the which gender suck more debate and i will not allow this sub to degenerate into that because it doe not benefit victim or survivor gt don t twist the conversation into who isn t guilty of abusing me so there it is going forth i will remove any notallmen post or comment if you want to rant about your male female whatever abuser then go for it no one should ask you to stop and consider the feeling of those who happen to share the same gender but are not also abusive let s add a few word about men can be victim too i know that we all do it doesn t come a a surprise to me a a woman or a a survivor that others share similar experience i don t believe that it derails the entire conversation like notallmen maybe i don t like seeing those thread because it come off a a victim feeling they need to defend their right to the label of victim and that to me parallel how i feel when i see notallmen agenda in the comment when i have posted about my own abuse it s the same battle for validation i do occasionally remove these comment when it go down the rabbit hole of certain agenda dogwhistles i won t name group here so there lie what is consuming most of a rare day off i may not be visibly on this sub but i am checking it nearly all day every day and if you haven t noticed the issue i am talking about then i am doing better than i thought a lot go on behind the scene you can comment below anything you happen to feel about my word today i will read everything and take it into consideration because i am not

my 29m girlfriend 27f is upset that i don t want my secret jewelry collection to be worn by anyone including her i m a completely closeted gemstone and jewelry enthusiast from long island ny i ve had this hobby since my early 20 s being incredibly careful financially so i can pick up a nice piece from a gem show or auction a few time per year always way below true market price after many year my collection ha developed into something truly special and i can look upon it with pride i grew up poor and the idea that i can have a certifiable box of treasure is an idea i draw strength from i also enjoy studying the scientific aspect of it to the point that to this day i still consider switching career to truly embrace it it s silly to invest emotion into material object but it mean a lot to me personally i also want to say that i m not rich by any stretch of the imagination i am solidly middle class and can only buy these piece using a method based on opportunism and keeping strict track of pricing the collection itself is composed mainly of loose gemstone mostly opal but with a hefty number of other precious cut stone like emerald and sapphire i even have a few gold nugget and some natural crystallized gold the rest is all jewelry and a lot of it is antique and or designer in term of that it s composed of a few necklace a small handful of pendant a large handful of ring several bracelet and a broach all of which i have painstakingly scouted and specifically chose to be a piece i want to add to my secret collection some of them are extremely nice one example of which is an art deco platinum cartier emerald and diamond ring from the 1920s given that this is a throwaway i need to impress upon you that this collection is or wa a complete secret to everyone except my brother who doesn t really care and my parent i grew up without a lot of privacy and i embrace having my thing thinking about my collection being safe secure and secret give me the same feeling a being wrapped in warm blanket on a cold winter night it absolutely relief my anxiety and it help me feel empowered to get to the point i have been going out with this wonderful woman for around a year our first anniversary is a little over a month away i have a lot of anxious hang ups and she really doe did put me at ease when we talk to each other it s like we just click and i m having trouble articulating why which i suppose is a good thing because the connection is so emotional it s beyond word a few month ago i felt safe enough with her to show her my rock collection i mentioned my rock collection to her a few time but she didn t really seem into it given that i already display some fossil which most people find uninteresting boring i m kind of a nerdy guy and definitely not the most fashionable person not a slob or unhygienic i just don t care about clothes or fashion le money spent on clothes mean more money i can spend on her anyway so when she saw what my rock collection really wa she seemed pretty floored like whispering oh my god in a really intense way and asking is this real about a few thing i honestly thought it wa adorable i answered any question she had and she seemed pretty surprised that i knew so much about jewelry i even let her wear some of it for a little bit but only for a few minute in the room and i did feel my heart palpitate a she did it i felt like we grew closer after i showed her because i really did feel vulnerable opening up to her like this she ha a few piece of precious ish jewelry herself but it s all shopping mall pandora tier bracelet a few thin yellow gold necklace she got for birthday and a pair of diamond stud earring the rest is all assorted non precious stuff that go with her outfit like her stainless steel onyx ring that she wear all the time fast forward a few day and the rock collection ha already been brought up a few time like she d be on pinterest on her phone and show me outfit that she think certain piece of collection jewelry would go with i explained to her that though i agree and she d look stunning i d very much prefer for the collection itself to remain a complete secret and that i only showed her because i trusted her she seems to understand this a if you advertise this kind of collection all you do is either make others resent you or set yourself up for a home invasion but her sticking point wa keeping them in the dark all the time is such a waste which made me nervous at that point i knew she wanted to wear them without her specifically asking me the idea of one of my piece being worn outside give me anxiety especially anything opal which requires special care and can shatter so easily that even seeing others with opal ring make me nervous i derive satisfaction from them being locked up and safe my line in stone is that i ll never let anyone wear my jewelry in the wild under any circumstance if she wear one ring one day it ll become a thing to the point where i can easily see the jewelry being worn semi regularly and my secret collection will be a secret no longer it won t be completely locked up anymore and it won t give me that feeling of privacy and security it d give me the opposite feeling because i d be wondering other thing like how much wear and tear is appropriate i d definitely start noticing scratch and other mark on them when i scrutinize them with a loupe that s just part of what happens to jewelry when you wear it no matter how careful you are not to mention them being stolen or outright destroyed in an accident at this point i regret showing her i always try to communicate a best i can that i don t feel comfortable with my jewelry being outside worn or shown to people i don t absolutely trust it ha become a point of contention a now it is brought up every day and that she s saying that i should want to cover her in diamond i even offered to get her a piece of her own that she can wear a much a she want but she told me that wasn t the point and that if she can t wear some of my jewelry on date that must mean i wa waiting for someone else to come along so i could put it on them it s meant to be worn who else is going to wear it it ha honestly gotten worse every day and i can see it upset her so i try not to bring it up but it always come up in conversation somehow and it never end up in a good place the environment between u ha gotten tense and we obviously aren t in the lovey dovey initial stage of the relationship anymore i m wondering how to approach this situation in a constructive way because i don t like seeing her upset but i also don t want to be what i feel to be manipulated into doing something i m uncomfortable with do i feel like this is enough to break up over no do i feel le comfortable in this relationship than i used to absolutely and it make me sad and disappointed is there anything i can say to her that i haven t already said i don t know what to do or say after i offered to buy her a piece of jewelry and she responded with that s not the point tl dr i have a secret really nice jewelry collection that i showed my girlfriend she want to wear the jewelry and i want to keep it locked up i don t know how to fix this situation without upsetting her because wearing it isn t an option,0

my boyfriend 24m left me 21f at my job for the second time and i m honestly thinking about just breaking it off with him writing quickly on mobile alert in advance for any spelling or punctuation error some background information we ve been together 3 year we have 2 kid and we have to share 1 vehicle we are both worn out an exhausted from dealing with a toddler and a 5 month old i am suffering from acute viral bronchitis complete with body ache going on 3 week now so i have been especially run down the rule usually is whoever ha the kid ha the vehicle in case of an emergency expect for on the weekday when he go to work because he go to work at 4 40am and i am not getting the kid up that early the first time this happened i worked at a university campus starbucks not too far from our place he drove me to work everyday because a parking pas wa 325 a semester and i didn t have the money for that my shift usually worked from 6pm 1am so when i got off my shift i called him i probably called him close to 20 time with no response and i really started to panic because he wa looking after our 2 boy i wa really close to my coworkers and supervisor there so i didn t really have an issue asking for a ride home when i got there i knocked and knocked for 5 min with no answer panicking i went around to the back and knocked on our bedroom window he finally answered the door he had been sleeping and didn t hear his phone i wa pretty angry but also relieved he wa ok and my supervisor didn t mind at all fast forward to now i m back at my old job the one i had before starbucks we work on assignment so sometimes there s work sometimes there isn t it pay considerably well for an entry level position but it s almost half and hour away from our place it is very corporate i literally sit at a cubicle making phone call and i do not have the relationship with my co worker and manager like i did at starbucks i ve been trying to work extra hard so i can get the position above me which is a team lead my shift is now from 6 10pm tonight i got off of my shift and usually he s texted me that he s here but he didn t so i texted him he didn t text back so i called him it went straight to voicemail i called him again and again voicemail every time so then i m thinking his phone is obviously dead so i ll just wait by 10 40 he is not there so i looked into getting a lyft but the idea of me being in a vehicle with a man he wa the only driver available at almost 11pm scared me off of it so now i have no choice but to go back into the building and ask for help i run into my manager the one who would decide whether i get the position or not tell her the situation and ask if someone from my team is there to give me a ride home she say no but her colleague someone else in a really high position and his fiancé could so here i am sick cold horribly embarrassed and just wanting to get home at this point they drive me home i knock on the door my boyfriend scramble to open it half awake and asks me who drove me home i told him it didn t matter because he didn t i then take a shower he ha yet to apologize so i finally confront him about it he tell me that i can t blame him because he wa tired and apparently our toddler unplugged his phone and so that s why it died i storm off to the room because of course he never take responsibility and then attempt to shift the blame back to me well why didn t you drive yourself why did you make me take you i didn t make him he offered and it s against our rule so now i m just sitting on our bed and he come in with that pity look like please forgive me and let me sleep and i m furious so i said no if he wanted to apologize he should have done it when i walked in he then proceeds to tell me fuck you and fuck your apology his apology to me you don t get a fucking apology and slam the door shut he is now sleeping on the couch like he wa when he wa supposed to be getting me from work like why am i so unimportant that he can t make sure his phone is charged ahead of time i m really hurt by this and his lack of empathy toward me this is not the only way he is unreliable i have had him told me many time sure babe you can have the night off i ll watch the baby just for him to fall asleep and not do it one time i wa in the shower he told me he d watch the baby so i trusted him the baby start cry i can hear him and 5 6 minute go by the baby is still cry and it doesn t sound like my bf is handling it i get out of the shower and the baby is wailing and my bf is sleeping right next him not budging again i am furious like i will never be able to leave him overnight with our child because he won t wake up tldr boyfriend left me stranded at work for the second time won t take responsibility cursed at me and honestly i m over all of it,0

my 26f controlling fiancé 22m think having a car before making baby is a luxury so i ve known my fiancé for like 3 year now engaged for 2 year and everything wa so beautiful in the beginning he wa such a sweetheart and would do anything to make me happy but since we re engaged he became so controlling he ha ocd so i can t really blame him for being a control freak but sometimes i get so tired of it idk if it s just his personality or if it s because of his mental illness the other day i wa just casually telling him i need to have a car before u getting pregnant so i could just go to the appointment by car when the baby is born it s just really cold right now in the netherlands so i wa already thinking about taking a baby outside in this weather i just think it would be nice to have my own car when we have a baby so i don t have to walk or go by bike with a little one he ha a car which he almost never us and i m not allowed to drive it because yeah you guessed it controlfreak nobody else is allowed to drive his car that s why i need my own if we re planning on having baby at one point it won t happen soon gosh no but i wa just telling him it would be nice but he became angry and started saying his mom raised 2 kid without a car no license it wa totally fine with a bike and that i m just overreacting and being a spoiled brat so many mom s not having a car and still being able to do all that and back in the day it wa all done without a car but i don t give a damn about others and back in the day i wa just pointing out my own goal and need i don t understand why he can t respect that now he s telling me i m not capable of raising kid if i really need a car when being a mom he think i m depending on stuff and not being able to do thing on my own wth i don t understand how that is correlated to each other and that s exactly my point i don t want to have a baby and then be dependent on others to drive me around or to already have a baby and then think omg it s really cold these day let s take my baby outside for a 30 minute walk to go see the doc in the freezing cold and then be like maybe i need a car but then it already too late it sound weird i know but if he doesn t want to spend the money i m okay with buying my own car but this behaviour just doesn t seem healthy to me now i m so angry and i just told him i don t want any baby because we keep having argument over thing like this it s insane my dad got my mom a cute little car when she became pregnant why can t my fiancé be like that ugh tl dr am i acting spoiled for wanting a car before getting pregnant i just want it to be easy for the baby and i to go to the appointment and i don t want to be dependent of my fiancé or other people to drive me around,0

my boyfriend told me not to dress like a vampire hooker to his work dinner m26 f28 1 yr tonight s my so s xmas work dinner he work for a relatively conservative bank in a small town for background sake he is a white m i am a black f last night i received a text from him saying i hate to say something about this but tomorrow is going to be a bunch of conservative as white people at the dinner don t go vampire hooker attire i wa taken aback to say the least i don t routinely dress provocatively and certainly not at a work function in december so i didn t really understand the need for such a crude remark so i popped off my main point being he s never voiced any preference about my attire unless i demanded one he regularly asserts he doesn t care i ve been his date to numerous work and social occasion i know how to dress conservatively between the two of u i am the better dresser i have literally felt embarrassed being in public with him because of how little he care i think his statement are a greater reflection of his own anxiety than the dress code there were hour of back and forth mostly my outrage at what his statement implied among the few cogent defense were that he didn t want me to misunderstand what kind of event this wa going to be or overdress and embarrass myself otherwise he did a lot of backpedaling and telling me i m overreacting i can t help but feel offended i m a confident person i don t believe i m responding to deep seated fear i look like a vampire hooker i understand that who you date is a reflection of you so i ve always tried to put my best foot or outfit forward when i m anyone s date i haven t had a bad experience meeting any co worker relative or friend of his the only thing unique about this is that he ha expressed this is a wasp y racially homogeneous group that he an educated white liberal male feel uncomfortable around this isn t my first gig a the token black date but it s his first time introducing a black so to a crowd whose reception he s concerned about when i brought that up he said he d already come to term with whatever ignorant bullshit might come out of his coworkers mouth which to me validates he s had anxiety over bringing his black girlfriend to dinner he said it wa low of me to suggest such a scenario one wherein he try to tailor his black girlfriend s appearance to be more acceptable because of the preconceived tension her very presence could create i disagree at this point i m uncertain whether i should go to this dinner because whereas i felt no concern or anxiety about the affair that s changed after tonight s conversation i also question the integrity of the relationship because i ve been in a number of interracial relationship but never one where i ve been advised how to behave before an introduction based on the perceived prejudice of a crowd my partner mostly loathes am i overreacting tl dr boyfriend told me not to dress like a vampire hooker when i meet his conservative white co worker,0
my daughter 16 y o told me that she s been lying about her long distance boyfriend age for the last month and he s actually 28 my daughter told me early december that she is dating this boy who life in a very far away country she said he s 20 which i thought wa a little bit old for a 16 year old today she told me cry that s she needed to tell me a secret she s been lying about and she told me her boyfriend is actually 28 year old i always wondered what a 20 year old boy is doing wanting a girl across the world rather than a girl he can physically be with of course i automatically know now that this man is probably attracted to just teenage girl and this is how he doe it i told my husband her dad for her and he wa very angry i told him that we shouldn t talk about it for a couple day since this is a lot and we don t have to worry too much right now because the man is across the world but my daughter ha been for the last month telling u about how he is going to visit her this summer and so my husband and i d biggest concern is our teenage daughter hanging out with a grown man we give our daughter freedom to see her friend on the weekend and drive to school and home up until this news my husband wa supportive of our daughter relationship we mostly i are thinking of telling her she cannot see him in person but can continue talking online because we both know whether or not we say she will probably continue to be with him in a relationship our trust in her is very small now though my husband is talking about tracking her camera roll and text message and limiting her app time so she won t be able to talk to the boyfriend a much and he will lose interest i agree that this is a bad relationship but i feel like it ll die down on it own anyway and probably won t last plus if we take away her contact with him when she s in a state of being so attached to him she could make a decision like choosing to run away to be with him when we don t react well any advice on how to handle this so nobody get hurt both my daughter and husband are ticking time bomb with anger my daughter wa pretty mature she admitted it wa wrong and she know and that she like him a lot and that s why she lied i can t blame her because at 16 i d do the same but a a mom i m very disappointed and angry and judgmental i also am thinking about what ll happen this summer when she think he is going to visit her still how can i handle that my daughter and her boyfriend i think are pretty promising on seeing each other soon tl dr my daughter 16 ha been dating a guy for a month and told me that she had lied about him being 20 and that s he s actually 28 how to handle this so thing don t get flipped upside down my husband is an anger bomb and want to track her phone and track this guy down and my daughter could make drastic decision based on her emotion and i m worried she might run away to him if we don t react well my daughter want him to meet her this summer too and i m not sure how to handle that,0
my dad 60 is dehumanizing my mom 66 at a level i ve never seen before i don t live there anymore but i want to write him a letter threatening to tell everyone he know about his entire life a a vicious abuser but i worry it will provoke him into killing my mom seeking advice on thing to do leaving isn t an option for everyone for my mom she ha stayed married to my dad to avoid losing their house to alimony she is the breadwinner and she need to keep the house because without it she ha no asset to prove that she can support her sibling who have been on the waitlist to immigrate for literally over 20 year their application are finally being reviewed this year i m saying this to make it clear that leaving isn t an option she is willing to do i don t agree with her choice but getting her sibling over here ha been her single life mission since even before she had kid and got married to the extent she ha sacrificed her personhood and happiness for it by remaining with my dad these were her decision at this point it just is what it is change might be possible when her sibling arrive because they d live in my parent house and my dad would not be king in a private space anymore but in the meantime i cannot just sit here while my dad make her life a living hell 24 7 he ha hit her in the past but currently doe everything possible besides hit her i already told her if he ever threatens to kill her or hit her that she should immediately call the police i really want to write him a letter telling him exactly how much i hate him and why tell him everything he s done to prove that i remember and threaten to call every single person he know and tell them every detail about what he doe to his wife and child i also want to tell him that i won t hesitate to call the police the very next second i ever hear out that he tried to intimidate my mom i want to do all this but they live alone unsupervised and murder or murder suicide is a very real possibility when it come to him i ve always been afraid to provoke him especially after i moved out because i m afraid of him taking it out on my mom so i m really asking for advice nothing came from google search about how to stand up to abuser without provoking them into abusing you thanks,1

i 28m got very drunk one night and my girlfriend 32f is now trying to tell me to go to therapy to address potential alcoholism am i being irrational to say that this is a big red flag we ve been dating for maybe a year and a half approximately i like her a lot we don t actually have many issue so far at all and we are good at resolving issue between u calmly which is great amp x200b i went out to my friend birthday party and drank quite a bit too much at it i don t exactly drink that much so my tolerance is pretty low and everyone wa passing around drink and buying each other drink and before i knew it i wa hammered like frat boy level hammered when i got home i wa really drunk and i must have looked smelled it too i remember the second my girlfriend noticed i wa really drunk she almost looked panicked like i needed help right away or something i wa drunk but not projectile vomiting falling over cant speak a full sentence drunk i tried going to bed then i got some slight spin when i got on my bed and i went to the bathroom and preemptively threw up just to make sure i didn t later it wa quick but still gross amp x200b now here s the thing my girlfriend doesn t drink at all she told me she ha literally never been drunk or high in her life and that she find the idea to be unappealing she never went to party she didn t have a sort of going out phase in her life she had a pretty insular childhood youth and she only just moved to massachusetts from missouri 2 year ago amp x200b when i woke up she spent a lot of the day looking sort of concerned and distant and then at the end of the day she said we need to talk and she said she wa terrified last night at how i wa drunk and that i could get myself to that level of drunkness is scary and that she is worried that i have an alcohol problem i honest to god thought she wa joking but she wa very serious and she said she wanted me to go therapy and that she is genuinely scared of the idea of going out with someone who get drunk like that out of 1 and a half year of dating this wa the first time i had ever been drunk i think the most i ve drank around her wa like 5 beer and i maybe drink at all once a month i told her that me getting drunk one night doe not mean i have an alcohol problem and she said that normal people dont get wasted thats not a thing and i said yes they do very occasionally it not a sign of something bad if someone get drunk one night over the span of year she said that she need me to be cautious and that i could have fallen over and died or gotten alcohol poisoning and that she is scared for me she also said that people typically get drunk because they have underlying problem and that maybe i have something i need to work out which caused me to get that drunk she then said she texted me the number of therapist near me and that she would really appreciate it if i visited them and addressed this before it becomes a problem i wa so so weirded out by this one night of letting loose and she want me to go to therapy amp x200b the thing is i really really like her she is normally a laid back person on most thing but this just seems like one massive red flag am i reasonable to assume that this is i mean asking your so to go to therapy because they got drunk for one night seems absolutely absurd and irrational to me amp x200b tl dr girlfriend want me to go to therapy because i got drunk one night,0

me m28 girlfriend f29 ha been getting closer to coworker friend m29 recently and is not communicating with me about it tldr gilfriend recently made a close male coworker friend who she text often and it make me uncomfortable hey there i hope someone can give me some helpful advice on this situation my girlfriend f29 and i m28 have been dating for 4 year now and we live together we were friend before we started dating and have always been open about our feeling and honest to each other that is why we feel feel so at ease with each other we like to share happy and sad moment together in the pursuit of growing together and having each other to support u during this relationship we don t have many friend and spend most of our time together not because we have to but because we genuinely enjoy playing video game together and watching show and just chilling we had a few bump in your relationship uring these 4 year but honestly we barely fight and get along very well so the reason i m on this reddit post is because since she started her new job she ha been made friend with some of her coworkers male and female of various age and especially one in particular m29 she ha talked to me about all of them and they all seem fun and we have planned to spend time with all of them together which is great what bother me is this one friend coworker let s call him joseph is acting differently than the other coworkers in the sense that he text her way more often than the others and with text that are haha funny joke type and over the top exaggeration but to me feel a bit weird and give me a bad feeling in my gut the reason i know this is because we both share are text to each other with my girlfriend and she wasn t shy of showing me these one text example include i love the ever living shit out of you you vibe with me and support me in way i ve rarely if ever had in a friendship but also i can honestly say i love you boyfriend me m28 a much a you do not in the same way but i love and respect him fiercely because i love you i know giving snip bit of text is not enough to paint a full picture but i also do not want to publish these text in full on the web again she openly shared these text with me and brought the fact to her that this kind of language seems a bit off to me and i wanted to raise my thought because that s how we are with each other we share the good and the bad so after that i decided to plan a hike with her and joseph so i can meet him in person and make my own opinion of him they agreed we did the hike all together and everything seemed fine to me he is actually a real nice guy who is very open and easy going and i liked him and besides the fact that he tried to awkwardly poke her in the rib to jokingly make her go faster at some part of the hike he behave nicely this happened about 1 month ago and ever since she had not shared many more of his text specifically so i assumed that they are just not texting a much but about 2 week ago i noticed she wa wearing a new necklace around her neck so i asked where she bought it and she told me that joseph gave it to her after his ex girlfriend gave it back to him and he didn t want to have it anymore i am happy that she told me the truth about it but it still feel a bit weird that a friend even a really good friend would do that so i told her my feeling and she said she understood so we moved on from it now 2 day ago i noticed she wa late about 1 hour from coming after her shift and messaged her that i wa worried and hope she wa okay she then texted back that she went to a fast food on the way home with joseph because they were hungry after work again i told her that i thought that worried me and she said she wa sorry and should have told me about it before they went there a to not worry me i told her i wa thankful that she wa being honest and acknowledges that she could have handled it better also she ha told me that she ha openly talked about being 100 platonic with joseph and he insisted that he wa not at all attracted to her physically in any way and that even if they would be dating it would not work out because they want different thing in relationship she told me that she would immediately stop talking to him if she felt that he wa trying anything or if i told her to stop seeing him i feel like i can trust her 100 and she ha proven to me in the past that she is trust worthy so i trust her judgement and believe her but i do feel that she ha been like 20 le open with me ever since they started hanging out anyways my question now is am i being too trust worthy i am having doubt about joseph mostly because of the wording in the text should i be worried have any of you had this kind of dynamic is this a case of emotional cheating or am i blowing all this out of proportion and there is really nothing to worry about also i am worried about the future because i know that there feeling can change over time and i am afraid that the more time they spend together the higher the chance that they fall for each other i really do trust her and do not want to deny her a healthy friendship because of my dumb insecurity but i want to make sure that i am not being played or standing in the way of a blossoming love relationship in which case i would prefer to know now so that i don t waste my time and we can all move on p sorry for the long post,0

my 26f husband 30 separated and i can t compromise on when he can see our newborn baby my husband and i are currently separated after being married for 3 year we ve been separated for like 4 month now i m currently living with my parent and he life back at our house i gave birth two week ago and i just want a little time to bond with my baby by myself he wasn t able to come to her delivery because he wa out of town and she wa born a little earlier than expected but i let him come over to see her when he got back now he want to see her every single day and i just don t have the energy for that my body is still healing from giving birth and i just want to be with her in peace for a little bit i don t mind him coming to see her but he want to come every single day and just refuse to compromise he s even asked me to move back in so that we can raise her together and so that he can be around her more often and i don t think that s a good idea he think i m trying to keep her away from him because i wouldn t let him take her to his house for a while but i don t think it s a good idea for a newborn baby to be away from it mother for a little while i m genuinely not trying to be mean or vengeful i just don t want him around while i m rejuvenating we aren t necessarily on good term amp he just give off awkward bad energy when he s around he s threatening to take me to court but i don t see why that is necessary because i allow him to see her and even if he doe go to court he s still not taking her i really don t care i just don t want him around every single day he doesn t understand how much pain and stress i went through being pregnant with her and giving birth to her and also my marriage problem with him i just want to enjoy her without and distraction for a bit am i asking for too much am i being selfish i don t think i am maybe i need a reality check because i just don t see it he think he can play family with me now because we are married and have a child together now but we have so many issue to fix of course i want my daughter to have her dad amp she will have her dad i just need a breather from everything am i making sense it wa so stupid of me to even have a child with him because we were going through thing way before our separation i guess this is what i get for being dumb and having a baby with this man tl dr my separated husband and i just can t seem to compromise on when he can see our baby he want to see her every single day but i d rather him come like 2 3 time a week so that i can have time to bond with her myself with no distraction we aren t on good term so he mess up the energy and i don t think that s good i m not trying to keep her away from him i m just asking that he back off a little bit instead of being so desperate to show his face every single day because that s not what ex couple who share custody do i carried her for 9 month and went through a very long painful experience giving birth to her i just want him to wait until she s a little older to take her with him,0

wife 35f think i m 35m cheating due to errant text how can i prove innocence or resolve this my wife 35f and i 35m have been together for 4 year this morning she call me at work asking who did you mean those text message for last night i m kind of surprised so i m like huh what message from me she proceeds to explain that she received what appeared to be text message meant for someone else sent from me they re not saying anything bad really just oh man tired went to bed at 3am barely got any sleep etc followed by not sure they re just ambiguous enough and sent at 1am and 4am that she s convinced i wa texting someone secretly the thing is i don t have any record of having sent anything from my phone plus i wa asleep and we were the only two people in the house she find it hard to believe that messenger or google voice accidentally delivered text message from someone else the message on her end say they were sent from my google voice account i asked her to call it back to make sure everything wa setup correct and of course my phone rang neither my message nor google voice app show any message being sent from me but obviously she doesn t believe me because people can delete message after a long conversation where i reassured her that we re going to investigate it and that it wa probably a glitch in the software she text me back later with who were you talking to the chance that it wa a glitch are so low so it s clearly opened up a wedge in an otherwise perfect and happy relationship i can t help but feel like i m the target of some elaborate scheme to destabilize my marriage or maybe it wa just a random glitch but you cannot even understand how much trust can instantly vaporize when there s that nagging thing that make your spouse look shady and you can t just explain it away added to this because of my job s policy she s wa already vaguely paranoid because i have to keep a code on my phone and not share with anyone i think it s crazy that there s any doubt about me though because i spend literally every moment with her work travel eating relaxing probably 18 24 out of every 24 hr there isn t room for another woman but in her eye that doesn t mean i can be carrying on some elicit thing on the side i e text based infidelity or even just a secret relationship ugh not sure about the best way to approach thing or how to prove my innocence it seems like anything i say sound like what every guilty guy say stuff like you re being silly this is crazy i didn t do it that wasn t me i swear tl dr wife received text that say they re from me but i didn t send them and it s creating drama how should i approach this,0

i 35m haven t had a date at all in around five year no matter what i try i just can t meet anyone i m tempted to just entirely give it up to spare myself the depression should i for the past five or so year now i ve been single not in a sort of single way where i have some girlfriend that come and go but in a single way where i m just eternally alone before this time i had a fun girlfriend and we got along great but she got a job in another town on the other side of the country we thought we might try to make it work long distance but it just didn t i ve been alone ever since i can t complain about the rest of my life i have a really cool job and make good money i own my house i have a nice car i feel like i m a fun person and have some cool hobby even though it s often alone i travel a lot and have made good friend in backpacker hostel all over the world that i still keep in touch with but all of this would be so much cooler if i had someone to share it with it doesn t even have to be anything serious just someone to hang with and have fun with and maybe be intimate with sometimes would be cool i d like a future and maybe would like to get married one day but i guess i ll wait and see if it s the right person first i just can t meet any lady at all to find out if they re the right person i m not sure what it is i feel like i have a cool life and am a charismatic guy but nothing work i even feel like i m an objectively good looking guy too i m six foot tall with good feature and i am in great shape because i run and go to the gym all the time i have no idea what it could be i ve literally done everything i can possibly think of or have had recommended to me i get nice haircut i keep my wardrobe updated and nice i volunteer i go to hobbyist meetups i go to board game night i ve tried apps and site i could go on and on i get advice from my female friend about thing to say how to dress where to go all sort of thing i try to use all of their advice and can t get anywhere i ve even tried the approach of not trying i ve gone for month without letting the idea of meeting someone come into my mind it doe help in helping me focus on more positive thing and staying happier for the most part but it s tough to not let little reminder seep through when i see a friend with someone or whatever at the end of the day the best i can assume is maybe having someone around is perhaps not a part of life that i should expect anymore i m trying not to be too hard on myself but all the factor at hand are just telling me in a practical way that i am not worthy or deserving of having someone around i d like to be positive and thing that i am worthy and deserving i really truly think that i am but the hard fact are that no one else seems to think so i ve done everything that i can so i just have to assume that it s entirely out of my control at this point i m considering putting it entirely out of my mind and just going with the fact that i ll be alone my entire life i do have fun stuff going on and good friend i guess it wouldn t be so bad but before i give up i guess my question is should i i m 35 i m not getting any younger or any more good looking it might be time to give up the fantasy at this point i feel like i would be happier to accept the isolation and celibacy and not even make getting out of it a goal or a thought at all i don t want to do that but it s becoming more and more obvious i may not have much of a choice if i want to have a happy life before i do give up can anyone give me any advice what should i do at this point because i really don t get it tldr i m 35 and haven t been able to even get a date in around five year it s becoming a really bad problem for me and i m tempted to just entirely give it up and spare myself the depression should i what should i consider,0

abusing my son because no one belief me no one ever believed me my ex can turn off the bad behavior like a light switch which tell me not only doe he know what he doe is wrong but he also doe it intentionally and know when and how to hide it to save his own skin if my son make the claim it s probably because i put him up to it that s how i m treated a a victim my son is going to be 15 soon and no one belief a teenager even if that teen is a good kid with good grade and doesn t cause any trouble he justifies his behavior by calling it parenting and i have no say in how he chooses to parent it doesn t seem to matter that my daughter wa suicidal and may have ended her life if she didn t finally get out of his house when she wa 16 she went through the same thing he is now she wa even hospitalized and the therapist didn t believe her when she tried to tell them but none of that matter i can t say anything without looking like a vindictive ex wife just looking to cause trouble even a i type this out i can see why people might think that but i know the truth he is so good at playing innocent and turning thing around on me that i ve reached a point long ago that i simply stay out of it i take the best care of my child that i can when i can we are very close and they know they have my full support i try to pretend that s good enough he won primary custody of them 13 year ago through his manipulation and of course telling the judge the truth of the matter only served to hurt my case there s actually a name for it it s called credibility discounting and study show that woman who allege physical abuse during a custody case are actually le likely to win custody of their child it doesn t matter if it s true it s automatically discounted and treated a if the mother is lying what i don t get is how my ex can treat the child like he doesn t want them there like they do nothing but cause him trouble and prevent him from doing what he want with his life but the second they ask to move out he resists go into a rampage about how he s calling his lawyer and they re going to destroy me in court have me arrested for contempt because i m obviously poisoning them against him he absolutely loathes that i never gave up my weekend custody even after moving out of state i pick my son up every single weekend without fail he hate that he once told the kid he wanted to make me disappear horrible i know but i can t prove that so it doesn t matter the fact is i want nothing more than to move on with my peaceful life without him but not without my kid had he been able to peacefully raise the kid under his roof there would never be any problem but he can t do that because he s an abuser and an alcoholic but there is absolutely nothing i can do about it a of today my son ha been at his grandmother s house for a week he had to return home to go back to school and fortunately she life in his school district he s barely spoken to his father who still won t pick him up and told him to just stay there grandma would have taken him home if he wanted but he doesn t want that he act like he s punishing my son by refusing to take him back in on monday my son told his dad he wanted to move out his dad just said uh huh uh huh ok talk to you later and hung up they haven t spoken since two year ago a similar event happened where his dad went on a rampage during a drinking binge son called his grandma and said he never want to go back home he stayed there for three month with virtually no contact then spent the summer with me 6 month in total all financial support lunch money wa cut off there wa no contact until he wa ready to return to school at the end of summer since there is no official custody change i couldn t keep him a much a i d like to he is very reluctant to change school so he keep trying to make it work with his dad but the frequency of binge outburst is only increasing he s hit my son multiple time cps wa called a recently a two month ago with no investigation it s a if they don t take it seriously anymore the police who have been to their house countless time and removed my son for the night numerous time also do nothing it s like they all sympathize and know it s a bad situation but somehow he stay just this side of the law so nothing can be done the system is broken it s the kid who suffer in the end three more year until he s 18 and i ll bet he too will be estranged from his dad just like his sister is now somehow i m sure it will be made out to be my fault that i poisoned them him dragging her across the floor and busting down door when she wa hiding had nothing to do with it oh wait can t prove that either it s sick,1
update my 22f boyfriend 32m ha trouble controlling his anger and ha untreated mental health issue hi all i wanted to thank you for all of your response on my previous i got so much support and i feel that it s appropriate to do an update posting anonymously on this subreddit wa a huge step for me so many people were blunt and honest about the reality of the situation based on what i posted i have felt hurt for so long and it felt great to get some feedback and support after i posted here i soon told my therapist and even read most of your response out loud to her it wa eye opening to me and she agreed that i m in an abusive situation and it s not my job to wait around for this person to change she also recognized the gaslighting and manipulation that wa involved which wa hard for me to accept at first when i talked to my boyfriend about my concern thing got pretty ugly he didn t respond to it well and we talked back and forth for about a week over text and phone at time he wa apologetic at other time he minimized my feeling even more and tried to justify his behavior at one point he said it wa ignorant and selfish of me to criticize his mental health issue okay guilting manipulation even gaslighting i couldn t take it anymore oh yeah and when i stood my ground and repeated the statement i felt intimidated and afraid when you blared on the horn threw the change and yelled at me he had the nerve to say this is all over text mind you and my friend therapist agreed i wa communicating very reasonably i feel scared and intimidated by you right now this whole convo is triggering lmfao are you for real throughout all of the back and forth since the initial incident happened the rage fit i finally opened up to my close friend and all of them were hugely supportive of me and attentive to listen they didn t know the extent of his rage and agreed that this wa unhealthy it felt really good to open up to them for so long i wanted to defend this person s behavior i broke up with him last night my friend and even my dad agreed that i don t owe it to this person to break up in person so i did it through text exchanged goodbye and blocked him on every platform i m excited to move on in my life and focus on my schooling friend and just myself in general thank you all again for the support and feedback i needed it i feel like my life ha been changed for the better and the response i got were huge for me to take that step tl dr listened to y alls advice dumped his as and i m moving on thank you again lt 3,0
is it still emotional abuse if it accidental and am i subjected to it my wife and i have been going for the past few year now for context one of the first time we got into a arguement more a misunderstanding she mentioned she had trouble controlling her tone of voice making her sound more annoyed angry than she really is so most time something wa said in a bitter tone from this point on i told myself it is just her lack of tone control sometimes i would call her out on it if i wa unsure so it s been going fine a few misunderstanding here and there no one 100 perfect now an example of these little outburst would be if i say something she doesn t quite hear she would look at me and with say what a if i am interrupting her saying some really outlandish or weird kinda making me feel like i m annoying another is a small thing say if shes brushing her hair in the mirror and i have to step around her so have to move she will but let out a big breath like the kind you do when you are abit irritated like ugh really even if i ask her to move politely beforehand to which i feel guilty when it happens now i ve tried bringing it up a few time in the past it only resolve in me being told do you really think i m like that which make me feel bad for bringing it up so i have sort of resorted to learning how to avoid such outburst even if they are unintentional so now i stay silent and not be the first to talk in long pause in fear i will be annoying will try not to step around her when shes doing something or if it s the only path i can take wait until shes finished at one point i tried to make friend online since i dont have many i talked to a few people and once i told her she seemed really upset a if i dont enjoy spending time with her so i left the friend group and haven t bothered ever since tip toe anything to avoid these feeling of guilt normally i am ok with this stuff but oddly a of late it s really been irking me and making me feel useless and annoying a fuck i dont know if my patience ha been thinned or what so with the context provided is it still abuse when it s not on purpose is this abuse i ve been questioning this for a while a it s been happening more regularly now,1

my 23f fiancé s 23m mother dislike me on the basis that she doesn t believe i m italian what do i do for some background information i wa adopted a a baby and have no contact with my birth parent my mother wa japanese and my father wa irish my adoptive parent are both italian like immigrant italian they speak with heavy accent and we speak a lot of italian at home i m fully fluent and have a bit of an accent myself i wa raised roman catholic in a predominantly italian area and most of my friend growing up were italian my name is also a le common italian name think giovanna but not that i have in essence lived the typical italian canadian upbringing i never thought twice about this until my fiancé proposed to me my fiancé and i started dating at seventeen and his mother ha never liked me she always acted cold and aloof even passive aggressive she seemed to be a bit overbearing to him and i always assumed she wa one of those mother who s afraid of her son marrying off and leaving her she s also a single mother with two other kid both daughter recently he proposed to me yay i ugly cried with joy and everything wa great until we announced it to his family a a family we had a nice celebration and nothing had gone wrong but after the dinner wa over he got a slew of angry text from his mother calling me slur not even correct one and over all insulting our relationship and our future child the general gist of the message were that she wa upset over my not being italian and she wa also worried about prospective half breed child who wouldn t be italian we were both beyond pissed and he called his mom and told her off she tried to make up with him a few day later telling him that she ha no problem with my being japanese or irish even though she s always wanted him to be with a nice italian girl literally her word apparently she just hate the fact that i pretend to be italian by faking my accent speaking italian taking part in italian tradition etc one of my fiancé sister is married to an italian man who doesn t speak italian and is nonreligious not a problem to me at all it s just that his mother is hugely religious yet she considers him to be more acceptable than me she also say that i ve offended her on a few occasion because when people ask about my race i get that a lot because i m biracial i state that i m italian it s the culture i associate with the most and i d rather not detail my family history to every person who asks me what my race is also i ll say thing like i m such an italian stereotype because i use a lot of expressive hand movement and the like which she also find offensive i found this to be kind of funny to be honest because it s kind of absurd and a bit hypocritical because i ve heard her make racist joke on more than a few occasion besides all the slur she texted my husband about me neither of u responded to this because we were appalled a well a astounded she would even say that now i ve started wondering is the above actually offensive of me is this just a ruse because she doesn t like my biological ethnicity what can i even do can i explain this to her tl dr adopted by italian parent raised fully italian my birth parent are japanese and irish my fiancé s mother belief i m faking my italian accent and other thing and find this to be personally offensive she also dislike the fact that i refer to myself a italian am i being insensitive is there a way i can explain this to her,0

i m 28 f pretty sure my friend s 27 m girlfriend 30 f tore up old and precious photo of mine from a childhood trip to notre dame cathedral due to underlying resentment towards me i ve known my friend for just under three year when we first met we were interested in each other and went out a few time but we eventually realized we were better off a friend the chemistry just wasn t there and the one time we tried to kiss we couldn t stop laughing he met his girlfriend about a year ago and they ve been going strong since i ve tried to get to know her and to be cool with her and all but she ha always had it out for me due to my history with her boyfriend which again didn t last long and went nowhere regardless she just doesn t seem to like me which is fair enough we don t have to be friend if that s not something she want and although it s pretty obvious that she doesn t like me to the point that other people in our social circle have in fact pointed it out to me on separate occasion i still make a point to say hello to her and to be nice one such time wa a week ago when i invited her to my housewarming party she and her boyfriend showed up together and everyone wa in the living room talking and hanging out at one point i brought out an old photo album and in it were a few photo from an old trip to paris in my childhood a we all probably know by now notre dame suffered a huge fire earlier this year i had photo from there that were very precious to me not just because of the fire that later took place before i could visit again but also because it wa before the age of digital camera and the negative were lost when my family moved a few year later so the photo in that album were all that i had left of that trip i wa very young at the time so the memory aren t that fresh anyway my friend flipped through the album and that one friend s girlfriend wa actually nice to me for once she sat by me and asked me about the various family trip and birthday and thing that were encapsulated in that photo album it didn t occur to me that she or anyone else at the party had it in them to tamper with the photo so i didn t think to put it away once we had all moved on to the next activity the food and drink came out and i forgot all about the photo album we played game and told story and had a fun night at one point i noticed that she had started flipping through the photo album again but i didn t really register what i had seen until after she wa the last person that touched it a far a i know once the party wa over and once it wa time to clean up i tucked the album away without opening it then a couple of day later last night i decided to flip through the album again for whatever reason that wa when i noticed the photo from notre dame were torn up not just in two piece or three or four or five or whatever they were torn up to the point that it would be near impossible to put them back together shredded i honestly felt like cry which never happens i didn t know what happened or how it happened without me knowing sooner that wa when i started running through everything that had happened at that party someone had intentionally torn those photo to bit and tucked them inside the protective covering so that i wouldn t know until i physically opened the album again that is not only fucked up and cruel but also disturbing i tried not to let my mind go there but there wa only one person at that party who would have done something like that none of my friend would have dared do something so mean my friend s girlfriend wa the last person with the album i don t know when she could have done it or how but i imagine she took it into the bathroom with her or something and went to work i don t know it sound crazy because it is no one else would have done something like that knowing how much those photo meant to me even if they were photo taken in my childhood house or the old street that i grew up on they still would have meant something to me why would someone do that how needlessly cruel although i have no proof other than my memory of her being the last one with the album that she did it i m pretty sure it wa her every bone in my body is telling me that it wa her when i spoke to another friend about it even they said so before i had even touched on my suspicion also not that it matter but i m not really even that close to her boyfriend anymore we re friend and we get along really well but he doesn t give me any sort of special attention if he did then i would completely understand her resentment towards me but it s not like that at all he respect his relationship and so do i and his girlfriend is mostly just passive aggressive towards me so her attitude isn t something that s easy to point out in conversation without potentially looking emotional or oversensitive my friend ha noticed the awkward tension enough to stop himself from laughing too hard at one of my joke and thing like that but that s about a far a it go when they first started dating he barely spoke a word to me for month so in that sense i had kind of gathered the vibe and distanced myself from him out of respect but we re still friend and at the party we did talk about this concert we went to a friend a long time ago maybe his girlfriend noticed didn t like that we were discussing one of our memory and chose to retaliate i don t know the only thing that s stopping me from saying something about the photo to either one of them is that i have no proof of the fact that she did it but i mean who else would have throwing accusation around doesn t seem like a good idea i just don t know what else to do i m so frustrated and upset and it s so obvious that it wa her but if i point it out to him or even hint at it i know i ll end up looking like the crazy one how do i handle this what should i do apart from never letting her near any of my belonging that much is obvious tl dr those photo were all i had of that trip and now they re destroyed shred it s obvious that she did it a she wa the last one that had touched the album before my housewarming party wa over and none of my actual friend would have done something so cruel even a a shitty joke not sure how to handle this i m never letting her near any of belonging again do i bring this up to my friend or do i just distance myself so that i don t look crazy throwing around accusation,0
my wife late 30 f hate my parent early 70 and won t let our daughter spend the night over at their place even if i m there she threatens to leave with our daughter if i early 40 m do that basically the title my parent are nothing but doting on our little one our two family have very different life philosophy my family is warm encouraging supportive her family is basically the opposite cold critical and basically it s your problem you figure it out so when we first got married had a bunch of financial issue mostly because i had just left a phd program but wa unable to get back to the workforce my parent offered their place rent free while we got on our foot her parent live in her home country which is where i am from a well though we immigrated to the u when i wa very young so we took it there were a lot of ups and down of course and thing seemed okay when we moved out my parent gave u a huge amount of money to help u get started again wife never thanked them but wa cordial one day we got into a big fight and she told me she never wanted to see my folk again would not allow our daughter to sleep over their place even if i wa there would not let my parent come over to pick our daughter up to go have a fun day with her i always have to be present and delivering daughter to my parent and would not let daugther have dinner with them ha to be breakfast or lunch and if i don t agree she threatens to leave with our daughter i believe this is absolutely ridiculous considering not one iota of anything remotely being called abusive happened between my folk and our daughter and top of that she spent 10 week in her home country with her parent and our daughter doing nothing while i slaved my as off here at home i m fine with my wife never talking to my folk again but the restriction on visiting are in my opinion extremely abusive we ve tried marriage counseling during our joint session wife would constantly belittle me to the point the therapist would intervene to stop her we can t have anything resembling a rational conversation i m considering invoking the same rule for her parent who live overseas no dinner no overnights it s not my fault they don t live nearby i m pretty much fucking done and ready to get a divorce can somebody convince me not to tl dr wife ha extremely unreasonable restriction on grandparent and daughter threatens to leave with daughter if i even bring up the issue i m halfway inclined to let her just gtfo and move on to the next chapter in my life,0

super vague question but is testing your partner a normal thing backstory i m 33m in a very complicated perhaps toxic on again off again relationship with a girl 32f yes i know that whole first sentence is a huge red flag in and of itself we had a place together but after a big fight breakup a couple month ago i moved out with nowhere to go i moved into my parent house temporarily i ll be out of here before the end of the year well the breakup didn t stick because they never do with u and we got back together within a couple week since i moved out we have broken up and gotten back together many time it s so stupid i know so my parent know a little bit about my relationship with this girl and they ve concluded that we re not right for each other the test we had been in a breakup phase for the last couple week our relationship wa reduced to casual light hearted texting here and there sometimes it would devolve into sexting we both really value sex and our sex had always been really amazing when we re not together it seems to be the thing we both miss most about being together another red flag i know this past saturday we had been texting intermittently throughout the day i had my kid 6 and 3 all day and overnight that night at around 6pm that evening the following conversation is this weird is it okay am i an asshole is she insane i just don t know what to make of it i ve had her blocked on everything since that final text but i still keep thinking about it and wondering if i m the bad guy tl dr my on again off again girlfriend conducted a test via text message in order to gauge my response to determine whether or not my intention were good or something,1

freedom eventually i m just here to share my story because i m a guy and guy dont really go and talk about this kinda thing and i wanna be a part of the change i wanna see in the world hindsight being 20 20 i ll put my new interpretation of some of these thing in parenthesis 6 year ago i met this girl while in high school she wa nice and she wa pretty we were friend for a year before starting a relationship thing were good until i started making female friend she then began to get clingy possessive getting upset if i went and sat with or spent any time with these friend tryign to isolate me making broad claim that i didnt like her and didnt want to spend time with her this whole time reminding me from time to time she s got depression so i feel bad for her eventually i stop seeing these friend anymore because she just wont stop getting distraught over it and i didnt want her to do anything drastic because i believe shes majorly depressed at some point in here we become intimate a many teenage couple do we use protection religiously but after a few month about the time i try to make new friend we have a pregnancy scare she tell me she wa pregnant but didnt know how to tell me but she miscarried all of this dropped in one bombshell she never gave any proof or even said she took a test i just took her word for it all of this probably to test the water on if she can manipulate me she constantly twist my word in her favor with everything we go through but i endure it because i care about her and i dont want her to hurt herself because of me a year into the relationship she proposed and with this awful feeling in my gut i say yes because at this point i believe she ll kill herself if i say no besides i say to myself people can be engaged for a long time before they marry i have time this wa i feel the point of no return for me from here we move in together and she consistently belittles me invalidates my feeling unless they support her opinion and override my opinion at every turn and if i dont agree with her she spiral into a fit of despair hatred and calm compromise always in her favor in that order she us this tactic to further isolate me from myself a at this point i dont have any friend anymore they just upset her eventually i m too weak emotionally and mentally from the constant strain of her hanging over me that over a few month we move our wedding up to that year we got engaged i m now only 18 still and she convinces me that if i give her a baby she ll be happy a that s all she want it doesn t work shes still awful to me all the time even after by now i m just a shell but even so in my subconscious i still hate everything about myself and my situation and this come out in flash of harsh self abuse my body now weak physically a well i start to lose it and somehow convince her to let u open the relationship probably only agreeing so i dont leave even here she exercise complete control over what s going on she convinces me to give her another baby just 1 year after the first because we need a pair i m not raising a spoiled only child now 21 and the abuse ha grown to include physical but i get the opportunity to get a work from home position in overnight it this is probably the best thing that s ever happened to me the job is slow easy and give me ultimate freedom from her for several hour a day i get bored with the job and start playing game while on the clock this lead me to joining an online group playing the same game a me i make new friend for the first time in year and meet an amazing lady there we hit it off real well and soon i m spending every night with these new friend my new lady or both i of course tell my wife about this new woman in my life and she begrudgingly approves because i wont let up about it again probably to keep me one night my wife come in and start berating me thinking we re alone and everyone in the house is asleep not realizing my mic is on and i m talking with friend thankfully once shes done and gone these friend are kind enough to start asking question about our history and they re brave enough to call out that it isnt right i honestly dont know any better at this point but they take the time to show me and teach me about what a good relationship should be one day somentime later she come in to berate me again and i just cant anymore i tell her i want a divorce she put up a fight about it but with the word of my new friend still echoing in my head i stand firm and 3 hour later she concedes thing are rough for the next 4 month while i try desperately to move out and get away from her i spend my day resisting her attempt to regain control and my night doing my best to decompress with my new friend and new relationship i finally moved out 2 month ago i get to see my kid every other week because this is a woman first state and at this point with how i wa forced to have them i m unsure if i want to be a dad it thought moving out would feel better like maybe everything would be fine if i just left that isnt the case though i still wake up too scared to open my eye some day out of fear i ll open them and be back there i still stress about napping i pretty much can t or over sleeping because she used to throw thing at me for that i think it will get better with time though all of it will i hope thing are better now though this new relationship i m in is going well and they are very patient with me considering what i ve been through i ll be seeing them in a couple week they live a handful of state away to find out definitively if there something real to what we have if there is i ll know i can still find happiness i m sorry if i miss thing or have error in my typing it s really painful to write this all out let alone reread it multiple time to make sure it right,1

engagement possible in 2020 but afraid to tell bf about credit card debt tl dr how do i tell my boyfriend about my 10 000 credit card debt my boyfriend and i have started to hint at getting engaged in the future dating just over a year my guess is that it will happen over the summer even though we live together we don t really talk finance we know approximately how much the other person make and we split rent down the middle but that s about it unfortunately i ve gotten myself into a bad situation with credit card debt i currently have approx 10 12k in debt that i m really struggling to get rid of most of it is from college post grad before i started my salaried job now i have a full time salaried job but i haven t made a dent in my debt every month i have plan to make a payment but at the end of the month i don t have anything left so i m not necessarily accumulating more debt but i m letting it linger any advice is welcome how do you talk to a so about your debt i m afraid that if he find this out marriage talk will be off the table also a for reducing the debt i know how to set a budget but i struggle with self restraint also my boyfriend make about 15k more than me and so i have similar expense to him but far le income for example he want to order takeout almost every night but i really need to reduce the amount of money i spend dining out,0
boyfriend didn t text me back while i wa in the er tl dr boyfriend wa unresponsive for 12hrs while i had a health scare and i m feeling a bit detached now hi reddit apology in advance for the incoming wall of text my boyfriend jay and i are both 29 and have been dating for 2 5 year living together for 8 month for the holiday i went abroad with my parent and jay went to visit his folk in his home town on christmas day in the foreign country where we were vacationing i suddenly became very sick vomiting and severe abdominal pain and my parent ended up taking me to the local hospital to have me treated for dehydration and to run some diagnostic test the doctor diagnosed me with appendicitis and really pushed for me to have surgery right there and then but my parent wanted a second opinion tbh none of u really trusted the doctor there and so we got on the earliest flight back home the very next day i called jay before my flight and afterwards kept him updated via text my parent and i went to our city s er straight from the airport and we spent 20hrs there while i went through a battery of test the appendicitis ended up being a misdiagnosis and what i actually had wa just a really bad stomach virus here s the part i m kind of pissed about jay didn t respond to my text for more than 12hrs while i wa in the er i knew beforehand that he wa going hunting with his friend that day so i just assumed that he probably had no cell signal but then i saw that he had posted some stuff on social medium during that time and it turn out he had cell signal the entire time and had in fact read my i m scared and waiting in the er text but didn t answer because he wa busy with hunting logistics since they hadn t mapped out the route spoken with the groundskeeper obtained the necessary paperwork beforehand and had to do it all last minute i called him a day after i got back from the er and basically unloaded on him i tried to be fair and not overly emotional but i wa really hurt that he didn t care enough to text me back while i wa vulnerable and in pain he apologized right away said that he had no good excuse for not texting that he just wasn t thinking etc etc i know that we ve technically talked it out and it s not a big deal since i didn t actually end up needing surgery and he ha expressed how very sorry he is but i m having a hard time letting this go we re still physically apart with our respective family right now and i don t feel like talking to him or texting him at all i ve been sporadically answering his text and i sent him a new year text but mostly i just feel kind of meh like i don t really care to hear from him or hear about how his day went i think there s still some resentment on my end and my way of coping with it is just straight up emotional detachment obviously this isn t the healthiest way to handle thing and i know that this small incident isn t a big deal in the grand scheme of thing but i m still having trouble moving on ha anyone experienced something like this would love any insight advice on this situation,0

how do i 29f listen to my very talkative husband 30m more effectively together 4 year married 4 month hey everyone tl dr my husband talk so incessantly that i am tired of listening to him this make it hard for me to respond to his sincere bid for attention and i would like advice on how to fix this other than ignoring him and losing my patience so this is pretty lighthearted and not the biggest deal in the world but it is something i am struggling with all the time in my relationship how much doe he talk my husband love to talk he is full of idea very smart funny and he is knowledgeable he ha been a talker his whole life a a teen he had problem with cornering people and trapping them in a conversation but he ha improved and doesn t do that anymore when i met his parent his mom caught me alone and said so how do you deal with it you know the talking i said i tell him lovingly to shut up sometimes and we laughed she told me he started talking at 2 and ha never stopped it ha been suggested to me that my husband may be a touch on the autism spectrum before he and his dad could be a hair autistic but the trait they have are mild compared to other autistic people i ve met so what s the problem i feel bad that i can t listen to my husband all the time he talk so much about thing that bore me that it fatigue me by the time he ha something important he want to share with me i have very little patience to listen i have started ignoring him and pretending to listen i didn t do this intentionally it s just a coping mechanism that developed organically my in law have been married for 30 year and fil talk a much a my husband and mil ha been ignoring him for most of their marriage they re happy and in love so it must work but it make me feel guilty i also will kick him out of the house lovingly for the weekend and make him go spend time with his family or his one or two local friend but it s only once a month or so husband is not very social my husband say he doesn t mind that i ignore him because he wish he could ignore his own brain sometimes he is very understanding but i really want to be able to be more patient with him and respond in a better kinder way to his bid for attention my husband spends quite a lot of time being gentle with me and helping me deal with my baggage daily struggle and past trauma with patience and grace i wish i could act a kindly to him a he doe to me but i keep failing i wear my heart on my face and have poor control over my facial expression and he read my face all the time and can tell when i m upset listening to him i have a short attention span due to a learning disability i really struggle i m not worried about our relationship lasting or not we have a rock solid foundation i am worried about the quality of our relationship and how i can improve it so he is happier how can i pay more attention to my husband when it matter how can i help him to feel heard by me how can i help him to be able to talk to me without me showing sign of my impatience or frustration for further reading on this topic example of thing he like to talk about what price silver is today and how silver is a stable currency that will hold it buying power over time how the world economic market is heading for a crash this honestly stress me out and upset me and i ve told him his project of the month this month it is learning to solder sometimes his project are too ambitious and i have to put my foot down and insist that he scale them back a bit his moneymaking scheme very dry technical stuff like the pathway drug take through the brain or the finer point of cereal crop and their production update guy you have all been so nice and supportive i think my biggest takeaway so far are a follows i need to work on my feeling of guilt at being incapable of listening to everything my husband say no one can listen to another person that much i have some internal work to do there i need to set boundary and make some signal that i need quiet time be it removing myself physically making a funny quiet hat etc i could try establishing a rule that if i don t have eye contact i am not listening my husband could start journaling posting to hobby group online filming himself make a podcast etc he need a creative outlet for his idea a lot of you agree that he seems a bit autistic or that he ha adhd but i think it s clear that he isn t neurotypical i have adhd myself my husband likely ha anxiety and need to address it somehow my husband need to get my attention before he start talking so he can be sure he is not interrupting me we a a couple need to communicate better together i need to verbally tell him when i am done and he need to verbally get my attention and eye contact i think this is going to go well it wa nice to hear that there are a few other weirdo out there who would listen to my husband s rambling i will let him know what you said,0

without him he had a dress code for me etc but he ha been trying to work on it and get more laid back and stop overthinking thing because it s caused issue last week wa my best friend birthday party though and they really don t like each other they got in a debate at my other best friend party and it ended badly so she said she didn t really want him to come but if he wa going to break up with me if i went alone then he could but he couldn t spend the night and i wa supposed to i told him that i would prefer he not come but if he really wanted to he could but couldn t spend the night he immediately started going off about how i wasn t allowed to go and i wasn t allowed to spend the night without him it caused a big fight because i have grown tired of all his rule the next morning i wake up and he asks me to join a call and after some begging on his part because i didn t want to i finally do it is him and his friend who he say is going to be our therapist because we need couple therapy i m upset because he s done something like this before and make it clear i am but still go along with it his friend tell him he s being unreasonable but say i need to try to be more accommodating too he end up coming to the party after i asked him not too getting super drunk insulting me and being super rude in front of my friend when he s not trying to get me to have sex with him and end up spending the night fast forward to this week i come home from school it s a four hour drive and go straight to his house because he asked me to i have been telling him i m in pain because of a health issue and he s been laughing it off i get there and he want me to drive him somewhere he doesn t ask just assumes i will i do but i m clearly irritated he get mad that i m irritated and say it s so he can buy me a christmas present the next day he come over to my house he said he d be there at 12 and didn t show up until 1 30 he barely speaks to me and when he doe it s with an attitude i ask what s wrong multiple time and he say nothing he fall asleep in my bed and sleep for over 7 hour i could ve woken him up but i honestly didn t want to deal with him being angry for that he wake up and we talk for a minute he mainly ignores me and play on his phone he leaf and text me a little while later saying he s getting drunk with his friend he invite me to a nightclub but i can t go that late a my parent are already asleep and he basically say he s going anyway normally i wouldn t have a problem with this but considering how he s controlled me i got mad and broke up with him he called me 25 time some i didn t answer some i did by saying stop calling he is drunk and tell me he get nothing out of our relationship and that i don t do anything for him like he doe for me even though i regularly drive four hour to see him have had to fight with my family defending him have given up all my privacy and have not been able to hang out with my friend without him in month i m obviously upset by this but he continues partying with his friend and it s not until hour later that he text saying we ll work it out but i notice he had turned his location off at the beginning of the night i never would ve been allowed to do this and that coupled with how he wa talking trying to be sweet then denying he did anything while his location wa off without me prompting make it seem like he wa with another girl we talk a little the next day and agree he can come over so we can talk thing out when he show up he say he want to take me on a date because he s sorry he wa an asshole i wanted to talk about everything that happened though so we do a little but he mainly just look annoyed the whole time he say he s sorry and will do anything to make it up to me but always add on how i f ed up too i tell him i don t want to go to dinner and he say if i don t he s leaving i don t go he leaf and i haven t heard from him since then a couple day i feel bad because i do love him and i know he wa trying to get over his issue to try and be le controlling and he did apologize i just thought it didn t sound that genuine he is really sweet sometimes and we ve always been really comfortable around each other and now i m sad and lonely because i miss him should i have just accepted the apology and moved on what do i do now that he s not answering my text tl dr my boyfriend never let me go anywhere without him and ha been rude lately he wa going to go to a nightclub without me and i broke up with him he apologized but kept adding blame on to me too so i let him leave instead of going on his apology date i don t know if i made the right decision,0

i 27f recently found out my boyfriend 30m pulled string for me over a year ago that greatly helped out in my career i feel pretty conflicted about it and he doesn t know i know should i tell him brian and i have been together for three year we live together and have every expectation of getting married eventually anyway he and i both work in academia but in very different field i work in the hard science he is much more of a humanitarian a little over a year ago there wa a project that a senior person in my department wa considering staff for i desperately wanted to be a part of it i applied pouted my heart and soul into my supporting paper for why i should be chosen etc in the end i wa selected and it ha been massively beneficial to my career i wa really really proud of that my field is still fairly male dominated and i wa really proud of myself for getting selected for this project and excelling on it and doing it all by myself with just my own merit except i didnt i wa having a discussion with the person who selected me for the project about an unrelated subject and we wound up reminiscing a little bit at some point he let something slip that implied my boyfriend had called in a favor for me way back when i wa surprised i knew my boyfriend wa casually friend with this person but it didnt occur to me that they had professional interaction i mean my department is stem my boyfriend s is humanity my senior wouldn t say much about it just that he had been a little on the fence about choosing me before getting an email from an old friend my boyfriend that made him sway to choosing me i wa pretty taken aback by that i wa so proud that i had done this without needing friend in high place and succeeding just on my own merit my pride is hurt a little bit over it i think i really appreciate that my boyfriend did something to help me out but it hurt a little knowing i wasn t a self made a i thought and my boyfriend ha never mentioned it to me he never said a single word about sending that e mail or knowing my superior beyond casual friendship should i tell him i know and is there anything i can do to repair my little bruosed ego now tl dr found out my boyfriend called in a favor for an accomplishment that i thought i did all on my own i really appreciate it but im also a little hurt best way to handle it,0

i m not sure if my 21f boyfriend 30m of only 1 month know my age a he hasn t ever asked me he ha mentioned he think big age gap in relationship are gross should i tell him or wait until he asks me i recently moved to a new town alone two month ago to start a job in my dream field i instantly clicked with the only other woman in the office who wa under 50 year old an awesome and fun 30 year old girl who ha a lot of the same interest a me being new to town she ha taken me under her wing and introduced me to her friendship circle i went to a few event with her friend and really hit it off with this cute guy we ve been seeing each other for about a month now so early day but i really like him i know he is 30 because she mentioned to me that mid last year the whole group went away together to celebrate it however when i ve been with him my age ha never come up in conversation i honestly thought he knew i wa 21 that my friend i work with must have mentioned it to him but i wa with him and another friend the other day and the conversation somehow turned to couple and age gap because of a tv show we were watching my boyfriend made a comment like wow that s gross i can t fathom why a guy would ever date a girl that much younger than him it s creepy why can t he find someone his own age the couple on the tv show had a 15 year gap now i know 15 year is a few more than 9 but it seems like a very strong statement to make i just kinda sat there awkwardly because i didn t know what to say especially with the other friend sitting there before you ask he doesn t have social medium his job doesn t allow him so i don t think he would know my age off there i think he must just assume i m around the same age of the rest of their group a i don t look very young so my issue is i don t know if i should bring up our age gap seeing a he hasn t actually asked me how old i am i don t want to make a big deal out of it because i don t think it s a big deal at all should i wait for it to come up naturally which i m sure it will very soon i would never lie to him if he asked me or should i just straight up confront him and say something like hey you were saying you think big age gap are gross do you think our 9 year gap is gross i don t want to scare him away please help tldr my age ha never come up in conversation before and i think my new bf assumes we are the same age he ha expressed a distaste for big age gap should i wait for it to come up or bring it up,0
i 26f recently found out my ex bf 26m helped my family pay for my eating disoder rehab and therapy i have no idea how to thank him how do i even begin to show my appreciation for what he did my ex boyfriend and i dated for 6 year up until 22 he wa incredibly patient in our relationship at the time we were dating i wa struggling with an eating disorder and other mental illness but when we first started dating i didn t go into full detail about my problem because i thought i had it under control i tried to hide my eating disoder until he caught me throwing up in the bathroom despite this he didn t break up with me and made sure i wa ok on top of it i wa dealing with anxiety and depression he still wanted a relationship with me i caused a lot of confusion and doubt in our relationship by going out of my way to hide my issue and the fact that i wouldn t eat i never did anything that would break my loyalty to my bf but i realize that this mistrust still put a strain on our relationship when i would hide thing like pro anorexia website and people that supported that lifestyle i started being completely open regarding my issue and we worked on communicating more but near the end of our relationship we had an argument that resulted in our breakup we met one time after breaking up and apoligized for our shortcoming in the relationship although i know a lot of those short coming were mine we agreed to have minimal contact and haven t seen eachother since we reach out on birthday holiday to say hi to eachother but nothing of romantic interest just last week wa his birthday and i told him i started rehab finished by now and therapy early into our breakup he said he didn t know that but wa happy i wa getting help my parent knew it wa his birthday and saw that i wa feeling down because i never got over him they took me to dinner to discus something important my sister told me that my ex bf had been helping them pay for my rehab and therapy my dad told me that he didn t want my bf helping but my ex talked him into it so all this time when i would talk about getting help he acted clueless eventhough he wa helping my family my ex bf and i haven t seen eachother since in 4 year but kept in touch with my dad and sister to see how i wa doing he acted like he didn t know a thing throughout all my recovery process i have no idea if he would even want to see me again or how to thank him for what he did for me and my family all advice is welcomed tl dr my ex bf broke up with me because i wasn t honest about my mental issue and eating disorder i wa under the impression he didn t want anythying to do with me but found out he helped my family get the resource i needed,0

i 31m am worried that i shouldn t have married my wife 32f of 1 year tl dr my wife of 1 year and i are not getting along and i m getting the increasing sense that we have wasted the past six year together repost to add in some more detail i could really use some advice a i m feeling incredibly and increasingly lost apology if this all seems a bit disjointed i m trying to put it in some rational order but there s a lot of facet my wife and i have been together in total for six year and married for just over 1 she is a talented singer and illustrator and just a generally all round creative spirit we met online and over many month slowly built up into a relationship we both wanted to take it slow a didn t want to rush into anything she is an introverted soul a am i she would say she is a worrier and anxious which i totally understand we both enjoying tinkering on our hobby music making for me and mostly illustration and design for her generally quite introverted together like two pea in a pod but we do see friend a well a few month ago she wa having quite bad anxiety due to a course she had signed up for and a a result got prescribed an anti depressant which ha helped her a lot it sound selfish but it come from a place of love over the past few month i genuinely think her overall mood and mindset towards issue and setback ha improved so much it make me so happy she is able to cope better a i saw how upset it made her when she wasn t able to deal two recent situation but the same common theme first one wa when we went to stay with my parent for a night i know it s a cliche but i know deep down that my mother doesn t really like my wife i think this is mostly because my wife only ha a part time job more on that below and can come across a a bit self centred when nervous from my perspective i always feel a bit tense when we visit a i am much more similar to my mother personality wise than i am to my wife so it feel like this side of me come out more which in turn seems to put my wife on edge basically both of u are on edge and this often result in mini argument when we are there my parent don t really argue whereas my wife s parent will have lot of mini argument my wife think this is healthier anyway at this specific night away we were getting ready to leave so i went into our room and said we re thinking of leaving soon are you ready or something to that effect just a legit question she seemed to take this in a bad way like i wa accusing her of being late so instead of risking another argument i just walked away i have been trying to do this more when i think her reaction are completely randomly out of order to an innocuous question the second situation wa when we went to view a house to buy together currently renting we had a meeting with the mortgage advisor who asked u for our payslip my wife couldn t get them until she went into work the next day and until we could provide them we wouldn t be able to make a formal offer we both loved the house so this wa a priority later that evening she said she wa going to call in sick the next day because she didn t want to do a rehearsal for a band a the rehearsal seem to be pissing off her manager she isn t sure why i said to her i would strongly advise going in to get the payslip because someone else might make an offer and we would need to move fast and said could she let the band know she couldn t rehearse tomorrow but maybe next week apparently this wa a selfish uncaring response i sort of understand but the whole reason i suggested going in wa so that we could buy the house we both loved this culminated in her saying forget it i don t know if i want to buy a house with you or even be married to you anymore if you re going to be like this i feel like whenever i try to stand up for myself it s perceived a being uncaring and that the route to a simple life would be to agree to everything but i can t live like that i feel like part of me ha been eroded already the backdrop to the above is that i m starting a new job next week and took this week a holiday to just chill out it s not that i don t like her being around but she ha called in sick the past two day to avoid rehearsing with this band and i feel a bit annoyed that i haven t had my me time to recharge a bit i am genuinely confused a to whether this is really selfish on my part i wouldn t dream of saying that to my wife a she would say i m putting my want above hers but i would love to hear an outside perspective being completely honest i wa hoping for at least one day this week just to be by myself in our place but a she ha been calling in sick there no time left and i feel much worse now rather than relaxed and ready for a new job over the past few month if we have argument she ha started to just outright say thing like why did we get married and i m not sure this marriage wa a good idea if that s how you re going to be i feel like she is a very sensitive person at time which i think also explains why she is so brilliantly creative but it feel like she can misfire and perceive social cue that just aren t there i am not a psychologist and don t want to diagnose my wife but from time to time i have wondered if she may be on the autistic spectrum then again it feel like a lot of people might be to some degree there s also an underlying current of money she work part time and so in term of cash contribution to our joint account i put in 3x a much the reason she work part time is that she wa previously studying but gave it up a part of the course wa causing her a lot of anxiety i like to think i wa supportive through this period and never brought up the cash contribution but it s starting to feel like she is getting used to working part time she ha two extra day off a week and i really have to stop myself being resentful when i hear that she ha had a lie in and not done much with her day i realise a i write this that i might not be sounding very fair we have talked about it a a couple and not got very far i just feel like she is on a very privileged position and doesn t really appreciate it but there s always been this gnawing sense that maybe she isn t the one for me i like to think i m caring and have really tried to work on being better a truly listening and show compassion instead of trying to fix situation a i am aware this is my default approach to complaint but i feel like i am hitting a brick wall a single reassuring sentence not said exactly how she want it to be said to her can cause a blow up though not a bad a pre anxiety medication i feel like she perceives the way i say thing in the most negative way and it s an uphill climb to get back to a point where she understands what i meant i feel like she is very sensitive to criticism and it s a very tricky subject to broach even if i said to her i feel like you are very sensitive to criticism she would get annoyed but then maybe i am a well it s just got to a point where i have lost a sense of my self and who i am before the start of the relationship we both had other small thing with other people no sex just a kiss and very brief i am well aware that it s very silly thinking to start imagining an alternate life what could have been the one that got away etc but i get confused about why i still think about the person i had a small thing with is it indicative of something bigger or just my brain being a fool again apology for the disjointed nature of the above i m just feeling quite lost and confused a to whether both of our life would be better apart or together i feel like we are so good together 90 of the time but i m not sure how much of that is because i ve shaped myself into being happy in the past before we were married i would put her outburst and from my perspective irrational argument down to her anxiety and that i knew the real person underneath it all but now i m not so sure would love to hear your thought and experience i m typing this in a coffee shop having just read a long email she ha sent me the gist of the email is that she feel like i m not a caring a i used to be and that she feel every now and again my resentment seems to come out maybe she s right update we spoke again this morning and i ve said that i am going to start counselling she is happy for me but reiterated that she deserves to be happy so we are seeing how it go far from feeling better i feel much worse this is because she brought up an earlier argument which happened the day my grandma died i wa telling my wife how i d spoken to my mum on the phone to hear the news and my wife asked had she died peacefully i said i hadn t asked a assumed she had she d been in the hospital for week heavily on morphine dementia 94 year old and she said you didn t think to ask in the tone that someone us when they are shocked and disappointed i said no and explained why but this led to a big fight anyway she referenced this this morning but she restated the story to imply that i had got annoyed at her when she asked is my grandma had died peacefully it s thing like this that are slowly driving me mad when all of her agency seems to be removed from any argument we have so it s simply me getting annoyed for no reason hopefully the counselling will help but thank you for any advice you have,0

my 41m wife s 37f mental illness ha devastated our relationship and i don t know what to do for the best we have been married for seven year and together in total for 14 before we got married my wife exhibited some anxiety and unusual behaviour stressed and a little paranoid about certain thing i had literally no experience in this and attributed it to her stressful job that she often talked about we got married and i naively thought that that security would help allay some of her fear she left that job with my and her family s blessing and encouragement shortly after we married this steadily got worse and around 18 month later she wa sectioned and spent three week in hospital she had been delusional having hallucination and wa paranoid and suffering from persecutory thought i d discovered a letter from a solicitor demanding money and found out she d been overspending and had got herself into debt the medical aftercare post release wa non existent and she soon stopped taking her medication we struggled on for a couple of year until she had another crisis she wa put under the care of the crisis team who were great she started med again and saw a therapist and psychiatrist she wa extremely anxious at this time and scared of me her voice told her that i wa against her etc so to try to alleviate the immediate stress her care team suggested that i stayed in our spare room to give eachother space which i happily did to try to make thing easier a time went on thing calmed down and we returned to some semblance of normality but we d got into a routine and i stayed in the spare room i didn t want to pressure her and potentially derail her recovery she wa unable to work which is fine completely understandable so we were on one income but she got into financial trouble again but this time on my debit and credit card i knew it wa happening but wa powerless to stop it then one day she announced she wa stopping taking her medication and would no longer see her care team she had not fully recovered and within week i saw her symptom returning delusion hallucination etc all the same thing from her original psychosis diagnosis we kept up appearance and plodded on until i found more overspending i tried again to put a stop to it but she got extremely angry and hit me her illness took over and she accused me of forging bank statement colluding with the bank lying and committing fraud etc that completely knocked me back into my shell and i wa unable to stop her spending until the money literally ran out when that happened she wa surprised denied any responsibility and accused me of spending it all i have now finally managed to largely rein her spending in by denying her access to my card but it s been incredibly stressful a i ve had to borrow from family and the bank to cover it so another 18 odd month later and here we are she still ha her symptom we re still in separate room she s understandably unable to work we have managed to talk about thing a couple of time and she point blank refuse to go back to the doctor or start taking medication she refuse to go to couple counseling with me we ve both said it can t carry on like this i feel after five year of this that i can t take much more we would have liked to have started a family but that s impossible now our life are wasting away stuck in this rut we had a serious talk about a month ago where we all but separated but then she kind of rowed back on the idea i still love her and i know none of this is her fault i know no one chooses to be ill and i know it s worse for her than me i worry how she d cope if we split her parent are nearby but she s pushed them away over the last few year but they would absolutely support her and i feel terrible about potentially not abiding by my marriage vow she ha no friend at all and ha alienated her extended family with some behviour related to her illness i m not even sure she totally understands the ramification of separating she said she would stay in the house but she ha no mean of paying the bill her parent are comfortable but i don t think they could buy me out and they couldn t fund her indefinitely neither of u are doing the other any favour prolonging this a it is i feel so guilty and responsible i often wonder what it is about me that may have made her like this i don t want to split but staying like this is untenable i can t force her to get help and i don t want another five year to pas with no improvement and the best year of my and her life gone i don t know what to do for the best i m sorry this is so long tl dr i don t know what to do for the best a my wife s mental illness ha put a huge strain on our relationship and after several year i feel like we can t continue she refuse help and counseling,0

i ve been in abusive relationship yet it took me year to even realize i m living another one to keep a long story short i ve been in multiple abusive relationship it made me a shell of a person who didn t think i wa allowed to have me own feeling and autonomy i wa suicidal i ve been diagnosed with ptsd anxiety depression the work i ve been in therapy for almost a year now which ha been a lifesaver my therapist is a god damn angel one thing i kept saying wa well i wasn t allowed to feel that way so i d keep it inside she pointed this out to me that i said this over and over and over it wa a turning point how horrible that is and ha given me the awareness and confidence to try and change that i m not completely better but i ve really come a long way since i first walked into her office i talk a lot about my husband in therapy he s a central focus on a lot of my anxiety but abusive never ever came into mind stubborn rash sensitive emotional but not abusive my ex were abusive but not my husband i came into therapy yesterday and vented some more about my husband i told my therapist of my horrific nightmare of my past my middle of the night anxiety attack restless night and day she looked at me and said i know this isn t what you want to hear but i think your husband is triggering you i think you re constantly living your trauma because of your husband and i think your husband is abusing you knowingly or not it make sense i had a feeling of it making total sense yet my brain wasn t and still isn t quite accepting it my husband is a good person you can ask any friend and family of his and they will have nothing but loving and kind thing to say and i do too he s a good person at heart and he adores me he s faithful and loyal to me but he doesn t seem to have respect for me he s emotionally selfish he act out and apologizes later but usually ha an excuse for his behavior his sex drive is insatiable but it s forced upon me instead of him managing it he objectifies me constantly and force himself on me when i try to kindly reject advance or say i don t want to do something sexually not in the mood he get angry and frustrated and say you re suppose to want this and you should like this that thing again where i m being told how i should feel i ve told him my entire history of sexual trauma i ve been raped and sexual abused he know this he held me a i cried uncontrollably trying to tell him my past and yet he still continues to talk to me and treat me this way and i always revert back to the girl i wa and stay quiet and let it happen because it s what i m suppose to do he grope and touch me out of no where sometimes i let him because i don t want to deal with his anger but sometimes i push him away and tell him it s not okay he say i m your husband why do i have a wife if i can t touch her when i want and again more of you re suppose to like when i do this when i ve come to him looking for an honest and open discussion i ve been met with uncontrolled emotional outburst horrible thing said to me then the next day he ll apologize but say can t you understand why i acted that way and expects me to apologize for making him angry i m now afraid to talk to him about anything because i m afraid of how he ll respond i feel a pit in my stomach when he s naked around the house he s going to start playing with himself and then eventually will draw me to him to rub him self on me or forcibly pull my hand towards him my therapist say i m living my trauma it s my why anxiety is ramping up and i m not healing she gave me couple therapy reference so i ll be doing that i love him i think he s a good person at heart but i think he ha his own problem he need to face,1
worried it will happen again hello i ve been with my partner for 5 year we re both in our mid twenty started dating when we were 21 i didn t realize he wa a heavy alcoholic and doing pill a well his abuse wa mainly verbal when he got drunk and upset he d call me name say fuck off or fuck you really mean streak in general though he s a very sweet natured person so i stuck with that i became an alcoholic a well i didn t feel like we could have a good time together without it when we broke up the first time i wa pregnant but considering aborting which i ended up doing but while i wa pregnant and emotionally distraught he got upset that i confronted him about drinking and told me to get the fuck out of his house screaming at me from the door until i left another time i came home and he wa drunk on the couch i tried to wake him up but i gave up so i laid down next to him on the couch he threw me off the couch then threw a lamp to the floor the second time we broke up he d been really distant going off with friend a lot and leaving me to clean the house it wa his house and he didn t help me with anything there he d usually turn everything back on me saying i wa the messy one if i wanted thing clean i should clean it the third time we broke up the last time two year ago we were both black out drunk and i woke up with blood on my face i d fallen and hit my mouth on the bathtub probably when i went to the bathroom when we either got home or earlier that night i didn t remember getting home from the bar i started screaming saying i d call the cop i ended up throwing my phone and his phone breaking both i wa freaking out for some reason i thought he had hurt me but he didn t i found the blood on the bathtub and knew it wasn t from him but from me falling down on it anyway he got upset because i insulted his family and he lunged at me and strangled me the next day when we were saying our goodbye he said well my grandpa choked me when i wa 5 a if to excuse it we got back together last year after he d gone to alcohol recovery that he s still in i started going to meeting a well and thing got way way better the only red flag i still saw were he d coerce me to have sex once i told him a few time that i didn t feel comfortable with him doing that did he stop and he hasn t done that since he even say he feel hurt that i engage in sexual activity even when i don t want to but i don t do that anymore and have learned how to say no and that i don t need to have sex to please a man if i don t feel like it overall i felt lost neglected and hurt a lot of our relationship thing are a lot better but there are still red flag such a communication i found out he lied about something a few week ago and the first couple of time i confronted him he both admitted and denied he d lied to me he said it wa because of my insecurity that he lied a couple day ago he got frustrated at a very minor thing and threw my laptop charger not at me or anyone else but at the wall when i wa in a different room then the next day he swore at our cat in a mean tone i m just worried that our relationship is still unhealthy and since i left all three time i m aware and able to leave again i m strong enough i have a good job i m also concerned because he hasn t seemed to fully grasp all of his past action a few month ago when we d argue or i brought up something i didn t like he d turn thing around on me blaming is what i d call it i always have to take equal responsibility for thing like if i say i don t like this but i know i do x similarly he still doesn t seem to know how to take full accountability for himself whereas i m always apologizing it take him a little while to think before he apologizes there are just these little thing that bother me but the thing is that he s working on those thing so i m not sure if it s still abusive he doesn t really fit into the abuser category at this point he s not a narcissist his angry outburst the other day doesn t happen often usually he ll leave the room if he s frustrated he s just barely started to put in what i feel is equal amount of work around the house but he doe weird thing like i can t eat a piece of chicken on his plate but he tell me he s going to take my gum then he end up using all of whatever i have but won t let me use anything of his without explicit permission from him i think he s just selfish now i don t think it s an intentional thing to control me or anything he doesn t yell at me anymore call me name anymore or ignore me and my need sometimes when i bring up my need he put it back on me and i have to tell him he can t do that i ve had to do that multiple time put up boundary for what i will and will not tolerate when we talk about thing i won t tolerate him blaming me and not taking responsibility for himself whatever it may be it could be trauma issue and lack of trust i don t completely trust he won t regress and go back to the way thing were or have an angry outburst and harm me but i m not sure what do you guy think,1

i 34 m used hot sauce at my in law and my wife 37 f lost it on me to put this in perspective my wife and i have been together for five year married for 3 we ve had our ups and down but mostly we re able to resolve argument with civil discussion we have 2 kid 9m my stepson and 2m our son together on saturday we headed to my in law about an hour away to meet up to get some advice on a recent purchase while there my mother in law graciously made sandwich i made a sandwich for myself and went to the fridge to get hot sauce none of the hot sauce wa open so i opened a hot sauce container my wife became upset and told me i had to ask before i opened it i apologized asked my mother in law if it wa ok to which my mother in law said yes it wa fine on the way back home my wife and i got into a major argument she said it wa arrogant of me to assume that i could take anything at my in law house i said that my intention wasn t to take anything i wa just opening hot sauce she said that she didn t care what my intention wa the argument wa getting pretty heated so i said that hurt my feeling since it did and we stewed for a bit she apologized for calling me arrogant but said that it wa a huge deal and it offended her that i wouldn t use manner to ask first she also apparently had a problem with me going to the bathroom at my in law without asking first it apparently would ve been fine if i would ve asked because that gave permission for that time keep in mind none of my actual in law approached me and told me that this behavior wa not acceptable nobody gave me dirty look nobody said anything to me nobody had a problem with the fact that i opened hot sauce and went to the bathroom only my wife this wa news to me since manner have never really come up i m willing to admit when i m wrong and i think my wife s point with this wa not the hot sauce or the bathroom but that it offended her and i needed to acknowledge that it offended her even if the action wa minor she even stated a much while we were talking about it i apologized for my action that offended her in the end am i insane am i getting gas lit i feel like opening hot sauce and going to the bathroom are two thing they don t really require pre permission additionally if the argument wasn t about bathroom or hot sauce and wa really about me acknowledging my wife s feeling then that s fine but it took about 40 minute of talking to even get to that point i understand people come from different upbringing my wife included and that manner are important to people i m even willing to apologize for something that maybe i don t think it is that big of a deal but might be a big deal to my wife and to end the discussion i did apologize i truly wa sorry that something i did caused my wife to feel so negatively what i m asking today now that i think about it wa i being unreasonable i understand that people have different feeling about different action but this ha never come up before wa this about the hot sauce or the bathroom i don t think it wa but my wife s not really the type to admit what a real problem is i know my account is biased and i may be leaving some thing out but even looking at what i ve written this sound crazy thought do i need to be more sensitive do i need therapy a a monster who doesn t have manner i feel like there might of been a breakdown in communication but i can t quite pinpoint what it wa tl dr wife wa mad about not asking for hot sauce or bathroom break at in law i didn t think i needed permission she wa offended at the action and wanted an apology wa i wrong am i getting gas lit,0
update i 32f got broken up with tonight by someone 29m i thought i wa gonna go the distance with and i guess i just needed to tell someone link to yesterday i noticed the key to his house that he had given me early on in our relationship so of course i wa very sad thinking of how close we had been and how much he had seemingly wanted me to be part of his life then i noticed something special of his that his mom had given to me that i didn t feel comfortable just throwing away i broke no contact to ask if he wanted it back and let him know that his key wa in the mail he responded and said i could get rid of it knowing that he wa looking at his phone i ventured even further across the no contact line to let him know that this wa so hard for me since he had played an equal part in how close we were and driven the relationship just a much a i had them he put up an emotional wall and ditched me without a real reason his response i m sorry for shutting you out i used you for companionship until i didn t need it any more i don t have any more answer for you it s a strange hurt it gave me what i need to never look back and fully know that i would never ever go back to someone who is so emotionally out of touch with themselves someone who could do that to someone but it also is making me question people we were good partner and took care of each other we never bickered and enjoyed our time together and he just pulled the rug out from under me and revealed an incredibly selfish person who wa i even dating a much a i want to tell him how selfish he is i think he know when i responded i told him you broke my heart in the process and this is going to be a hard wound to heal i do appreciate the honesty and i think i will leave it at that because i will never regret taking the high road i shared so much with this person and suddenly that person doesn t exist at least i can intentionally move forward now tl dr ex boyfriend who dumped me after seemingly wonderful relationship told me that he used me for companionship until he didn t feel like he needed it any more,0

wa this sexual abuse hey everyone this happened to me a few month ago and for some reason i can t stop thinking about it this happened to me while i wa dating my ex boyfriend 22m and i wa 19f there wa a lot that went down while we were dating he cheated on me never put any effort into the relationship and he had a drinking problem that is just some background information where i would like your guy s opinion is on what went down during our sex life at the beginning of our relationship i made it very clear that i wanted to use protection very clear i just explained that wearing condom make me feel safe and i am not comfortable having unprotected sex at first he wa fine with that he never pressured me to not wear condom and it wa great but after a few week he would ask me over and over again to have unprotected sex with him he would pressure me a lot to not put condom on one night we were at my apartment and we were hooking up same deal we d make out get naked and then i would get the condom to get thing going but that night once again he wa giving me a hard time about wearing protection and wa really not taking no for an answer he wa on top of me and asked around 7 8 time if we could just not wear a condom i kept on telling him no and that i really just wanted to wear protection he pinned me down and said well it s time to face your fear and tried to penetrate me luckily i retaliated and covered my hand over my vagina and stopped him before he could actually have sex with me he got really frustrated and said in a pissy tone to go get one a condom and to put it on him i did because i didn t want to get him any more angry and i felt really uncomfortable looking back now i should have just kicked him out but in that moment i wa actually really scared fast forward other time we had sex i m at 99 sure he would stealth me he would take off the condom without me knowing i caught him once in the act and other time a soon a we finished i would turn around to see that he wasn t wearing one could he just have lightning speed when taking off condom maybe but considering wa drunk most of the time i would say that it wa unlikely i did get tested and everything wa alright but i wa so heartbroken and scared after i though he stealthed me i don t have an anxiety disorder at least i don t think so but i am just naturally an anxious and nervous person about most thing this whole taking off the condom situation gave me such bad anxiety for 2 5 3 month because of my fear of stis anyways i ve been cycling this memory in my mind for a long time now what do you guy think wa he just an asshole or wa this abusive,1

dealing with anger i can t forgive him because he doesn t even know what he did to me he s so emotionless and it s always one guilt trip after another he say he didn t know he wa abusing me it wa emotional sexual abuse even though i told him countless time and stayed with him for over a year after first calling out the abuse i m so angry i don t know how to let the anger go without forgiving him but i can t forgive him because he doesn t understand what he did i know i don t need to forgive him but this anger feel suffocating i know i m entitled to my anger but i don t want to be angry i don t know how to keep living like this i feel like a pot of boiling water where the lid is shaking and any moment i m ready to boil over from something triggering me i m going to therapy and it help sometimes but the self help and the good habit feel so forced sometimes i don t know what to do with all this anger i didn t deserve what happened to me,1

boyfriend m39 breaking up with me f38 out of nowhere i ll try to cut it a short a i can but i became pregnant when i wa young and immature because of this when i realised i wa missing the experience my friend were gaining i started partying taking drug and fucked up by having an affair my boyfriend found out but his reaction wasn t a explosive a i wa expecting he just told me that we re staying together for our son and that s it we never spoke of it again for about a year afterwards i could tell he could barely stand the sight of me but getting caught forced me to pull my shit together i realised that all i wanted wa to grow old with him and ended the affair i threw myself into being a caring and attentive girlfriend and convincing him to forgive me and eventually we became intimate again and thing went back to normal he never proposed but i wa ok with that because we acted like a married couple anyway and i have to say the past 16 year have been picture perfect we rarely fought and even when we did it didn t last long we ve been on vacation together he wa there for me when my parent died split parenting our son evenly wa a great father and wa just the best partner a woman could ask for i thought the incident at the beginning of our relationship wa forgiven and forgotten then 2 day ago we celebrated our son s 18th birthday at the end of the night while we were getting ready for bed he sat me down on the edge of the bed and calmly told me that we would have christmas together a a family but after that me and him were done i stared at him and laughed thinking this wa some sort of prank but then i saw the expression on his face and realised he wa serious i started cry and asking what i did wrong and whether there wa someone else after a few second pause he reminded me that after i cheated he said we would stay together for our son now that he s 18 he should be emotionally stable enough to handle his parent separating reading through this now i could almost laugh at how messed up this whole situation is but i feel like i m losing my mind i ve been cry almost non stop and i don t know what my next step is i ve tried asking him if he s willing to work on it but he say cheating is a deal breaker for him and that our relationship ended the first time i slept with another man a far a he s concerned everything we ve shared since he found out i cheated wa just a co parenting fwb situation and while he love me he s not in love with me and hasn t been since he found out he assumed i understood and accepted this silent agreement i doubt anyone here ha dealt with anything like this before but right now i need all the advice i can get amp x200b tl dr i thought my boyfriend had forgiven me for cheating but when our son became 18 he told me that we would be ending thing even though this happened 16 year ago,0

my 30f husband 30m make buy me jewelry i don t like and get offended when i don t wear it basically my husband ha given me some jewelry for christmas birthday present over the year dating 6 year married 2 i m always very appreciative because i feel like telling someone you don t like their thoughtful gift is pretty rude sometimes he ll make necklace or bracelet himself which make them extra meaningful however the issue is that all of the jewelry is completely opposite to my personal style i always wear dainty gold jewelry and in comparison everything he ha given me is chunky flashy masculine in style it tends to be made of stainless steel and very thick solid metal piece or thickly woven chain everything look very heavy and to be honest doesn t go well with my personal style which is more casual and minimalist i wore a necklace he made for me for over 2 year straight because i didn t want to hurt his feeling but during that time i got several comment from people asking why i wa wearing such a chain simply because it looked so different to my fashion it s also very thick so it s not something you can simply overlook in an outfit in every outfit wearing the necklace wa the focal point like a statement necklace i also wore a bracelet he bought me for 3 year straight and also got similar comment about it over the year i ve told him that my personal style is minimalist dainty and in gold tone i have honestly lost count over how many time i ve said it but it seems like every time i get a jewelry gift it s the same style i ve stopped wearing the jewelry he ha given me except for special occasion but recently he s been getting very offended that i don t wear it more often especially since i used to wear the bracelet and necklace every single day what should i do now that i usually wear jewelry that i ve purchased and chosen myself i only ever get compliment and positive comment tl dr my husband give me jewelry that s not my style and get offended when i don t wear it i don t want to hurt his feeling what should i do,0

unsure if this relationship is abusive or not please help sorry if formatting is bad i m on mobile this is also going to be a bit of a long one a there are many factor at play trigger warning for sexual assault and bpd when i wa a young teenager i began a relationship with my best friend of 4 year my parent absolutely hated him and told me that if anything went wrong not to bother talking to them about it because they warned me i think that they were just thinking of stupid teenage fight and not that he d start holding me down writing derogatory thing on my body and taking photo of it beating me and burning me and eventually raping me i felt very alone and very frightened of what he d do to me or himself if i tried to leave obviously it did end for anyone curious a female friend took me to see a movie which wa a big no no in his book a weekend and free time wa for him i could see my approved friend at school but i wa left with severe anxiety depression and eventually borderline personality disorder after i left home my folk aren t really pro mental health i received dbt and can mostly keep my wild low and urge to split under wrap unfortunately i still have a very hard time setting boundary and am willing to spend all my time and money on people because i m both terrified and certain they d leave me which is the biggest fear of someone with my mental health problem that s where this complicated situation begin i have a friend who we ll call mark during this story when mark and i met he had a very abusive girlfriend and i being super sensitive to those who were in a similar situation to the one i wa in convinced him to leave and get help through this process we became very close and skipping a few heartbreaking thing he did in the process of recovery we became so tight we might a well be in a relationship although we re not see mark doesn t come from the best family either and when push came to shove and he might have to move back in with them i offered that he stay at my place with reduced rent so he could save and find his own place or he finished his uni degree that wa seven month ago in these seven month mark ha slept in my bed with u occasionally getting intimate it started off amazing he always ensures i m okay knowing my history and the one time i did have a panic attack he stopped immediately and took great care of me a a shoulder to cry and lean on he ha been absolutely stellar and in those early month i could genuinely feel myself improving and becoming more trustworthy of men after a few month i asked if he d put a label on it but he said that due to his last relationship he wasn t really ready i understood and backed off little warning blinker started flashing in my head when he started borrowing money from me for his hobby and for his rent it wa fine at first 50 here 100 there all with promise to pay me back of course hobby are very important and it wa just small amount then 200 then at one point 800 on top of this i also paid for all of our combined grocery bill most of the rent he s still paying at the reduced rate and all the utility after he promised he d stop asking for money i started noticing thing still showing up in the mail and found out about his monthly deposit to a cosplayer on patreon but he continued to claim he didn t have the money to pay me back or that he d forgotten and spent all his money he also would forget to do the chore or would regularly sleep in and not get up until an hour before i returned from work so mess would pile up until the weekend when i had time to sort it out i do 90 of the cooking and 100 of the chore even though i wa petrified he d leave or hurt me i had been feeling good about myself and confident he wa a good man so i put my foot down i told him that it wasn t fair he wa buying thing for himself and supporting a random tiktok girl when he owed me close to 2k i told him i wa tired of doing all the chore and that he should help a it wa only fair to my delight he agreed he apologised for being lazy and forgetful and agreed that he d help me out he d do the chore while i wa at work and i d do them on the weekend while he wa unemployed until he got a job he agreed to pay for the grocery every 2nd week and give me 150 200 fortnightly to pay back his debt to me he did this only for one week he slept with a random girl he met on tinder who wa only in town for 3 day ditching our plan together over those day to spend the day afternoon night with her and then crawled back into bed with me the very next morning i wa shocked and hurt for month we had been sleeping next to each other cooking together snuggling up to one another and he felt this wa okay because he wasn t in a relationship which i guess is technically true but still hurt like a bitch and completely broke my trust these day he spends all his time on the computer only to ask me for favour like could you please get me a drink some ice cream even though there s really nothing stopping him from getting them himself at night he spends all his time on his phone sometimes until 1 2am which suck because i m a light sleeper thanks to my past and i need to get up for work quite early he ll often say he s too tired too sick for our plan but will ask me to give him a lift to a house party down the road the same day recently he ha asked me to leave work early so he can get a lift to run some errand organise job for him and lift every which way including 4 hour trip sometimes we hardly actually speak like we used to and that break my heart this relationship feel very one sided at time manipulative and like i m being used however i ve been in a real abusive relationship before and this doesn t feel like that i m worried i ve created a precedent with my over generosity and therefore made it seem a if this behaviour is appropriate and or i m making up how bad it is in my own head due to my mental illness an outsider s perspective and advice is very much appreciated and i ll try and field a many question a i can including thing i might or might not have done although this is a throwaway so response may be delayed thank you for all your help i apologise for any typo,1
i 43f declined to be my friend s 41f moh or bridesmaid and it s causing issue i m someone who is planning to be single for life i ve realized i am not really cut out for long term relationship a i like to do much own thing a little too much i m fine with that but my core friend group at the moment are basically other single men and woman my age so it s not a if i m lonely i am also an organizer and i have a bit of a reputation in my group a an excellent maid of honor i have done it 7 time now over the last decade and my spreadsheet and trello board are something equally laughed and and revered yes i know i m ridiculous and a bit extra but they really do help keep track of thing but in the end the people i spend effort on have always shown me how much they appreciate it even if they think i m a bit extra i have had a high school friend who i ve known for awhile now she s never been happy single but it s taken her awhile to fine the one she s been seeing this guy for about 2 5 year anyway immediately after she met this guy she predictable cut back the time she wa spending with me quite dramatically i don t blame her it s the normal thing to do but i went from seeing her once a week to maybe once a month at best or once every 3 4 month over the last few year and it s always with me initiating a meetup a year into her relationship i stopped initiating meetups at all so our interaction have been occasional text like once a month or her liking my social medium post in the meantime i turned to other friend and network and life move on at 43 it s not the first or last time this ha happened this sort of thing really hit it s peak when i wa in my late 20 to mid 30 s so to avoid being lonely i have a wide network of people and social hobby however i got a phone call from her saying that she wa engaged so i congratulated her and did all the usual how did he propose and the ooohing and ahhing over the picture of the ring etc she then asked me to be a moh i wa honestly not expecting this because we haven t talked in person or on the phone in over a year and half and she hadn t bothered to reach out to meet up at all i don t feel close to her anymore and honestly i wa only expecting to be invited a a guest if at all normally the older you get the smaller your wedding get i guess my problem is that i wa diplomatic i told her i didn t have the time to take on moh duty a i wa very busy which is true but i would have made time for a closer friend she then asked me to be in the bridal party and i again mentioned that i didn t really have time she s gotten upset with me because i ve been a mutual friend s moh last year for a friend and helped a lot with the wedding planning and stuff in general because my friend and her fiance faced a family emergency illness at the time to the point where even the groom wa singing my praise at the thank you speech but my friend even though she wa in relationship still met up with me twice a week and we d have nice phone call at least once a week she wa present and showed she valued the relationship so i stepped up for her when she needed help and helping her did take a lot out of me for the 6 month when thing were critical but i don t regret it i feel like with this particular friend there wouldn t be any payback really for any effort that i would put in but i didn t want to get into all of that with this individual because i knew it wa just giving her ammunition and opening up a can over worm that wasn t going to be easily resolved i know from enough experience when i ve brought issue of not spending lot of time together up friend have thrown my single status in my face a a derogatory thing so now i let people who want to be in my life make the effort and i understand if people put their partner s first but when i have a set of friend who will spend time with me frequently and regularly irrespective of relationship status i will focus my energy and affection there i offered to give her my spreadsheet and trello board to help her out with the wedding planning because i wa started to get a sense that she just wanted a free wedding planner in the guise of a moh rather than me in particular the conversation kept revolving around how good i wa at planning thing etc not i really want to share this experience with you it s now causing issue in my friend group because other mutual friend have agreed to be bridesmaid but no moh and people assumed that i would be it a lot of my friend are completely understanding of the time commitment and the distance and support me but now if i get tagged in a fb post doing an escape room or something on someone else s wall i get a passive aggressive comment like omg decent_moose you look like you had a great time from her when she s never bothered before recently i got a wall of text from her saying she thought we were better friend that than and that she thought i d be there for her i haven t responded so i got another wall of text about how she missed our friendship and she wonder why i never kept in touch i commented back with a neutral life happens doesn t it she s then gone and told other mutual friend that i have tendency to cut friend off once they get into a relationship because i m bitter or jealous and i m single at this point it wa kind of predictable that my single status would come up but it still hurt every time luckily my friend have completely had my back on this and one even threatened to drop out of the bridal party but i m at a complete loss here on how to proceed i ve never had someone do this do me usually if we drift apart we drift apart i ve never had someone come back and try to make me part of their bridal party what do i do here tldr friend who didn t put effort into our friendship after she got into a relationship want me to be moh i declined and now she s bad mouthing me,0

getting really tired of my 28m wife 30f constantly criticizing my alcohol consumption habit how do i tell her to stop this my wife ha gone through a bit of a health oriented phase in the past year or so yoga exercise vegan meditating the whole shebang however it also resulted in her being way more critical of my habit notably drinking she wa never a big drinker ever i think part of it wa that she spent most of her 20 in a pretty rural conservative area so she never really went through any kind of party phase and she doesn t have much of a frame of reference for what is normal drinking she would get drunk off of 3 beer and then be hungover for what seemed like eternity i like to drink not alcohol abuse level but maybe 1 2 time a month i ll go out with friend drinking to a bar or a party or something and maybe 1 2 time a week i ll drink a few beer at home max would be 2 3 beer other time i ll go a few week without drinking mostly just because i forget to pick beer up from costco for a while lol amp x200b she doesn t like this at all she is constantly chastising me for it and saying that it destroying my liver and the other week she literally randomly texted me article on alcohol abuse and asked that i read them i wa just taken aback by this she think i am abusing alcohol i asked her if she thought i wa some kind of alcoholic and she responded that she feel that i could be leading into it and that she feel horrible for my health every time i drink i brought home a 24 pack of beer which we have always had in the house and she wa freaking out at me saying this is ridiculous your gonna drink all of this and i told her it over the span of week that this is drank and she basically just said it so much alcohol do you even know what this is doing to your liver and just generally seemed to be totally irrational about this again we ve been married for 5 year now we ve always had box of beer in the house she ha started basically chastising me every single time i open a beer either big or small chastising and at a certain point it almost feel like an act of rebellion just to drink at all almost like i can literally hear her telling me no every single time i take a sip amp x200b it not specifically about the alcohol i didn t drink at all from age 22 23 due to a health issue part of it is also a pride thing i feel like this is extremely controlling behavior on her part to try and remove a fun activity that i enjoy partaking in in moderation just because she doesn t like it i almost feel like i don t want to give her any room here to let her know that this kind of controlling stuff cannot be accepted in our marriage and the constant criticism of an activity i enjoy shouldn t be accepted either amp x200b i did say something bad to her which i shouldn t have and i regret it she is sort of into a lot of weird herb and essential oil stuff you know snake oil i have always kept my mouth shut about this because i know it a habit she enjoys when she wa critiquing me over the drinking i told her that i don t critique her for her weird fake snake oil stuff she consumes that she ha no idea how dangerous it is she got very upset at this i felt horrible right away and started to apologize but she just looked very hurt amp x200b our relationship from this post probably sound awful but honestly it overall very good and we get along 99 of the time fine i definitely wouldn t say it on the rock at all but this specific issue is frustrating to even think about it a big dividing thing between u now i am putting my foot down and telling her please do not criticize my habit like this and she is not really getting that amp x200b how do we resolve this amp x200b tl dr my wife keep criticizing my drinking and saying it unhealthy despite it being a normal moderate level of drinking,0

there is light at the end of the tunnel a successful nc story last year i met a guy that i became fast friend with and after month of him being persistent i finally agreed to hang out with him a month later we were official this guy 22m and i 21f should ve never been together i knew this my friend knew this my family kind of knew this yet i chose to ignore the red flag because i wanted to be loved and he made me believe that he could treat me the way that i always wanted to be treated of course i wanted to give all my love to someone too and went to great length to be the perfect girlfriend quite early on into the relationship problem started to pop up i convinced myself that these problem were normal and that all couple argue but this wasn t normal and i know that now i went to my friend s house and wrote down a pro amp con list i needed to know that i wasn t crazy i needed to know that the verbal and mental abuse i faced wa real it felt like i wa making a big deal out of nothing until i started to say it all out loud and my friend were horrified he s abusive they said we love you and we don t want you to get hurt still i couldn t let go my friend would see what a terrible state i wa in and when they asked i would tell them amp then make excuse for him he had a bad childhood amp still had issue with his family even now or i would lie to cover up how he treated me it wasn t until i went to visit him in his state he had been traveling to visit me more often and he literally blew up at me that i realized i needed to break up with him there s no relationship that is worth the constant ridicule and abuse he would make me feel like i wa a worthless human being and that i deserved to be unhappy that i wa a waste of space the day finally came and i decided to read my list over to ensure i wa doing the right thing memory came flooding back to me of course never the bad one right it took me reading my pro con list and realizing that even the pro were actually con i really had a hard time coming up with one good thing about that man he ruined my perception of love he made me think that i wa unworthy of love he yelled at me constantly he pouted he acted immature he couldn t communicate he forced me into having sex even when i didn t want to he caused me to have two of the worst panic attack i ve ever had in my life which i ve only had 3 time prior in my life and they were related to being over stressed from school a stress which by that point i did not have to face because it wa summer at one point in my life i wished that i wa good enough the first two month were the hardest after the breakup i would cry every day then i became angry i dressed differently i acted differently and i went after any guy i could just to get attention i wanted him to find out somehow i wanted him to think that i wa better without him that i didn t need him to look good or to have a good time obviously true but i wa going about it all the wrong way i put myself in some dangerous situation out of spite for his stupid selfish narcissistic self he wa not worth it he didn t add to my life he only took away if you re sitting there asking yourself is it worth it do i keep this person in my life for the good time i ll admit it s easy to get caught in that cycle of high low you become addicted to the little scrap of attention they throw at you and to the moment when they act a if you are worth their time it becomes just enough to where you re willing to forgive them for the gaslighting the yelling the manipulation the guilt tripping the lack of empathy and concern for your well being all of it i m here to tell you it s not worth it i realize that now and although i think i realized it a few month ago it took me until now to finally get back to myself i wa diagnosed with depression and anxiety after i finally went to the doctor to get help the medicine that i wa given ha truly helped me blocking him on my social medium ha helped too i don t need to see what he s doing and he doesn t get the privilege of knowing what i m doing even after you break up you ll find yourself wondering what are they doing what do other people think of them i would get angry because no one seemed to understand what a terrible person he is i ve made my peace with that because you know what i hope they never have to i know that abuser don t always abuse everyone he is the particular kind of abuser that picked on someone that wa weak and easy to manipulate i hope the next girl will be stronger than me and if he chooses to try to abuse her she can get out of it still sometimes i m torn between wanting to punch him in the face if i ever see him again or pretending like i don t know who he is i m in the latter now because i know i ll see him again we are in the same program at school and i ve just gotten lucky that i haven t seen him since we broke up i made myself one promise the day after i broke up with him i will not contact him not at all i have not broken that promise and it s been almost half a year now if i can do it you can do it too and on those day when it s really hard when all you can think of is him or of the good time remind yourself of a shitty time make a pro and con list you might also find that there are not any pro to dating an asshole like them today i decided i wa ready to make this post i m ready to help others with my story and i hope i can help you too i took out my pro and con list after month of having it stashed away and i didn t even have to read it i just knew he is a part of the past now and he always will be i ve forgiven myself mostly for my naïveté and falling for a loser like him i know he wa a predator and came after me when i wa at one of my lowest point then just continued to make my life worse it s okay to be upset it s okay to be mad while i do not forgive him for anything i am doing my best to forgive myself because the reality of it is any of u could have fallen victim to a narcissist and abuser it s not just me million of others out there have struggled too please if you re going through this there is hope you can end it you can maintain no contact you can and you will get through it,1
my friend wrote me this letter ending our friendship please help me with this email i have received from my friend ending our friendship after a decade i had no idea i wa a bad friend i am f m 37 and my friend is f m 37 we both have professional job and met a undergrad student when we were 24 i think it is only fair to give you some closure so i will answer your email then block you from sending email again this doe not need to be sent through my work email i hadn t heard from her in week so i emailed her work email the entire time i wa sick you cared more about your man drama and drama in general than how i wa actually doing you caused a lot of drama and stress for me when i needed to be healing i worried a lot about you and the men you would go out with i wa afraid you were going to end up in a bad situation and i lost sleep over it i wa on a couple of dating site and some date were bad i shared with her the issue i wa having and i absolutely regret doing so i wa unaware they caused stress for her i had zero idea she wa that stressed out about it and i wish she would have told me you were nasty to me the last biopsy i had because i told everyone on facebook and you didn t receive a personal message from me my mother found out on facebook too i wa super sick and went home to sleep the second the biopsy wa done you didn t allow me the room to be sick on my own term i am still battling through and have a lot more to come before i am healthy again i wa simply sad that i didn t know about it i thought perhaps she told me and i forgot so i felt terrible i wanted her to know that i wa there for her if she needed me when you were dating the guy that wa the graphic design graduate you wanted him to come join my profession because it would be easy that wa offensive at best i have worked really hard to be the kind of professional i am you treat me like i am below you because i am a lowly paid teacher money doe not equal happiness in this world i have gained a lot from teaching and coaching he wa a former teacher i never told her it would be easy just a simpler transition since he already had experience the icing on the cake wa the day you sent my husband three different message in facebook messenger about racist white people that wa at 10pm when we were laying down to go to sleep how is that even appropriate you have been nothing but disrespectful to david then decide you want to send him stuff like that what wa that about you have made sure i know how much you hate white people and all they stand for i am white and i can t change that i have never looked at anyone based on the color of their skin i would also not group every person of a certain skin color in together my white skin will not change and i will never forgive being lumped in with statement about all white people i am in no way racist i think she got this impression because i believe in equality for all people also i have never disrespected her husband to my knowledge i said hello to him on facebook and sent a funny video people block you on facebook because your photo are inappropriate you were wondering why the teacher couple you knew blocked you on facebook after inviting you over i am sure the photo you put up on facebook made her uncomfortable most of the cosplay photo belong in an album to show your significant other not paraded on facebook to make married men uncomfortable woman do not appreciate feeling like another woman is pursuing their husband the way you dress and show off your body also doe not appeal to woman the way you dress to show off your body and the photo you put on facebook have hurt you in many way you are beautiful without needing to show off your body you are brilliant and that should matter so much more than look i had 2 cosplay photo from more than 10 year ago on facebook they were classy and tasteful when she say show off my body she is talking about form fitting jean and tank top in the summer i wasn t trying to make anyone uncomfortable i never knew this wa ever an issue for her i have tried desperately to help you over the last 5 year you do not want the help or you would have taken some of my advice you have continued to pursue the same type of men with the same result nonstop i truly hope you are successful with the new boyfriend you find value in money and education without finding value in people and the hard work they put in having an education doe not make a man successful you have focused on a man having a college degree instead of a career that ha hurt you in numerous way i wa trying online dating and wa having bad luck for a while i feel so bad for ever telling anyone about this i actually met the man i married right before she sent me this email we celebrated our first anniversary in december and she is incorrect i value people and never specifically wanted someone solely because they went to college i have earned a certain level of education and i wa hoping to meet someone with similar experience my husband ha been supportive of my education and this wa what i wanted more than anything she wa thinking i wa a gold digger because i bought my own home and i wanted a better life than what i had before i used to live in a basement with rodent and cockroach and finally got out of that situation i wa looking for someone that wanted some comfort in life wa all our life have come to a point where they are not on the same path i feel like you have changed a lot over the last couple year it seems like you value making money and how you look above all else i value my husband my family and the peace that i have found in my life i may not make a much money a you but my bill are covered and i can travel when i want i may not be a beautiful a you but i have a man that love me and will be with me for a lifetime i have found a peace that i may have never found without a cancer diagnosis i am making sure i can keep that peace i am a bit lost on this last part i wanted to live better than how i once wa never enough money for food going to food bank and etc i do not know why she wa making comparison here i am sorry that our life have went separate way i really hope that you hear what i am saying and really think about it i can t continue to give up my peace of mind i hope that above all else you find a man that love you and realize that being brilliant will last a lifetime after your look fade had no idea she wa ever giving up her peace of mind i must be oblivious but i asked over and over if she wa ok but i suppose she didn t want to share that tl dr my friend emailed a letter stating why she wa ending our friendship i wa unaware she felt this way these were misunderstanding because this doe not reflect the truth 1 should i ask to speak to her to explain where i am coming from 2 i did not know i wa this terrible of a friend should i ask her to reconsider,0

my bf 26 m let his cat play around with one of his fish a punishment after it attacked the other fish in the tank i m 23 f horrified by this but he say i m overreacting and too soft for reference i ve never owned an animal of any kind before and thus don t know much about common house pet my bf grew up raising all kind of animal reptile bird fish horse etc and definitely know what he s talking about there are time i ve questioned him and been utterly wrong every time so i ve learned to just back up and let him take care of his pet a he see fit we used to argue about how he wa raising his bengal cat specifically how he punishes it for misbehaving sometimes the cat will attack me very roughly i think a a show of dominance since he never doe it with anyone else or when anyone else is in the room or maybe bc he s bored a my bf told me bengal have more energy and need to be played with moreso than most other cat if my bf hears it i usually am yelling at the cat to get off my leg he retaliates by picking the cat up and putting him in the sink and running water all over him until he s soaked when he climb up onto surface he shouldn t be on the table countertop my bf will yell at him to get down and if he doesn t he ll get up and push him off the table i know cat are sturdy and can handle these thing but it just feel unnecessary to me and a bit rough i don t think that the cat associate these punishment with his bad behaviour at all hence why he continues to do these thing but last night i think my bf crossed a line he ha an aquarium containing cichlid and a plecostamus we recently bought two oscar and they ve been getting bullied by one of the cichlid we watched closely and were hoping the behavior would stop but the cichlid continued terrorizing not only the oscar but other cichlid a well aggressively biting tail eating one of the fish s baby etc so last night my bf decides to take him out of the tank and place him in solitary confinement a giant bowl of water for the night we had been drinking a little bit and two of his friend were over so we were all a bit tipsy and i quickly forgot about the fish until i noticed the cat messing with the bowl i asked my bf to please move the fish somewhere the cat wouldn t mess with it but he instead sat the bowl on the floor of the living room and watched with his friend laughing a the cat pawed at the fish i wa clearly distressed about it and told them it wasn t funny my bf said you know the cat won t hurt it he s just being inquisitive but i m sure the fish wa distressed a well after about 15 min of having to watch his cat toy with the fish my bf picked up the bowl and flushed the fish down the toilet i wa shocked i will say that the fish have since seemed much happier they no longer hide a much behind rock and plant and they look much more colorful and healthy but what my bf did seems beyond cruel imo i tried expressing this to him and he and his friend laughed it off saying the fish wasn t harmed at all and that it wa necessary in order to keep the others safe and healthy what do you guy think i didn t want to intervene completely since they are his pet but now i feel guilty for not taking action sooner how do i let my bf know that i respect his ability to properly raise his own pet but that what he did wa i think cruel and crossed a line tl dr my bf let his cat toy around with one of his pet fish after it bullied the other fish in the tank all week nearly killing one i told him he crossed a line and he say i m being too soft,0

my boyfriend 28m want me 25f to learn how to code but i don t want to sorry in advance for the length tldr at the bottom this ha been a long standing issue between my boyfriend and i and i m curious what you all think before you say it this is not a serious issue between u and our relationship is founded on healthy communication and respect we ve discussed this issue many time but i want to hear some other perspective we ve been together four year living together for two some brief background me 25f working full time in the mental health field into writing community activism starting a master s in counseling program next year i grew up poor to lower middle class still broke with lot of debt i like to spend my free time reading weaving playing board game my boyfriend 28m software engineer with a master s in mechanical engineering he grew up middle class and came into a lot of wealth at 18 invested in property and now is very well off he like to spend his free time working on personal project and teaching himself new coding language and or tool a well a playing board game and listening to podcasts when we first met my boyfriend showed a lot of interest in teaching me how to code i wa curious but also nervous i would embarrass myself in front of the guy i just started dating but the curiosity won out and fortunately for me in his word i wa pretty good at it so he taught me a few basic thing we didn t really continue the lesson not for any reason but our schedule and other obligation over the year he s pushed me to take online course and further strengthen my knowledge in coding while i want to i have always been a bit hesitant about learning his craft myself i take a lot of interest in his professional and personal project and have learned a lot just through him explaining his work to me i genuinely enjoy hearing about what he learns and asking plenty of question i also brainstorm with him often about what he s working on regardless of my personal domain knowledge in the subject at hand this is all to say that i am not disinterested or ignorant about his field i think it s fascinating and feel fortunate that i get to learn so much by just being around him i suppose my reluctance to learn is because it feel like he is pushing me not because of anything to do with me but because it is a dream of his to have a partner who also code he really want to build thing together and eventually both work remote and travel the country something he ha the mean to do my work is obviously very people oriented and investment in my community is a huge goal for me both professionally and personally i think coding would be a super valuable and exciting skill to have but i m not interested in making it my profession or even serious hobby i am deeply invested in my field and feel most myself when working with people rather than tool so while i am open to exploring something for the sake of my partner coding isn t really a skill i can tie into the work i want to do in my field unlike writing and reading which are hobby i deeply enjoy and spend a lot of time on so towards that end sometimes it feel like a waste of time to invest dozen of hour into something unrelated to my passion that would at best be a side job or a hobby with my boyfriend but even typing that seems very selfish to me i don t know here s an example of this exchange that occurred recently gt my father wa recently diagnosed with cancer and i ve had a really difficult time focusing and feeling good about anything i mentioned to my boyfriend i want to find something productive but also cathartic to do in the evening after work to stay busy and also feel better gt gt him you should code gt gt me i m open to idea i think i want to brainstorm a little more i m looking for an activity hobby where i would be working towards something but that would also be enjoyable and creative without feeling like more work gt gt him well i think coding meet those qualification for x and y reason that s exactly what coding is for me and i think you would feel the same way gt gt me i hear you but don t feel like coding would be the enjoyable creative outlet i m looking for gt gt him if you say so you don t know that am i being unreasonable here sometimes i feel like i m resisting him because of where he s coming from rather than considering my genuine interest in the proposal but at the same time it s not like i have endless time on my hand to spend on any hobby or project i want to use my time in way that feel good to me tldr my boyfriend is a computer programmer i am a mental health counselor since we met four year ago he ha been pushing me to learn how to code but i have been reluctant to do so,0
i 23f cried yesterday and now my boyfriend 27m isn t speaking to me my boyfriend 27m and i 23f have been living together for month and we ve had zero issue i love him but i had never cried in front of him until yesterday what happened is i ve been planning to quit my job after this project is over at the end of the month i asked my bos for 2 day of pto next week and once again my bos tried to weasel out of giving it to me when my boyfriend heard my bos wa being reluctant he told me to just quit now instead of waiting until the end of the project i agreed that this wa ridiculous and i should probably just quit early but i explained that i really didn t want to burn all my bridge since i really appreciated one of my co worker i didn t want to make her life harder by quitting before the project finished i got my bos to give me my pto and i told my boyfriend i had gotten it all figured out my boyfriend still insisted i should just quit early and i kept explaining why i wasn t going to do that but he wouldn t really take no for an answer he kept wanting me to justify myself and i tried to shy away from the conversation but my boyfriend wouldn t leave it alone eventually i sat down and tried to explain myself one last time and i just couldn t handle it anymore i started cry i wa sleep deprived i hated my bos it wa two day before my period and now i had to justify my own decision to the guy i loved i didn t want my boyfriend to see me cry so i managed to get out i m sorry and then i left the room to try to cool off fast forward an hour i m still cry in the other room by now it s a full blown anxiety attack and it s gross and i don t want anybody to see my boyfriend come in and i immediately tell him i m not mad at you i m just overwhelmed i m sorry he came over and sat next to me in silence for a long time i cried i said thing like i m sorry our opinion on this are just different that s all i asked him if there wa anything he wanted to say and he shook his head eventually i asked if he wanted to go to bed and he got up so we went to bed after a long time of petting cat and me trying to get a grip i explained that i wa just mad at myself for staying at this job for so long i explained that i don t have a good handle on when i deserve better and when i should make change in my life he finally spoke up and said paraphrase that s fine that s why i m here i can tell you when you deserve better i replied yeah but i still didn t say i wa going to quit early ultimately i feel like this decision should really be in my hand and i m grateful for his advice but i think i need the final say in my own career this is a difference of two week of work so i m not sure why he s so set on me quitting now he may feel like he know what s best for me but i m fully capable of making my own decision and i don t like being coerced into doing what he want he think he s being helpful but when we disagree and he won t stop pushing his opinion it feel like he s just being controlling thing is i couldn t get him to really participate in the conversation enough to explain that i wa feeling trapped and defensive i hardly got three sentence out of him and none of them gave me any idea about how he felt i still have no idea if he s mad at me for leaving the room to cry sad i m not quitting now just irritated with my bos disgusted with me or what today is no better he really isn t speaking to me and i can t even get thing to go back to normal he seems entirely shut down and it s tense a hell i m trying to give him space but maybe i should ask him to talk to me again i have a few option at this point amp x200b 1 ignore my breakdown entirely pretend everything is normal for however long it take i m usually nothing but optimistic so i don t know if he s just freaked out by me being sad 2 send him a text or something to ask if he would prefer to talk there i get it it s super hard talking to people when you re worked up and i won t judge him if he need some degree of separation before he can communicate 3 apologize tell him i ll quit early obviously the emotional hassle of not quitting early ha far outweighed the hassle of quitting early but i also feel like if i capitulate now this sends a bad message about how i expect our relationship to play out in the future 4 point blank in person tell him i need you to tell me how you feel it s driving me nut to not know we need to talk because this whole silent treatment is not helping amp x200b tl dr my boyfriend tried to tell me to quit my job earlier i disagreed he insisted i started cry and now he won t communicate with me how do i resolve this,0
i wa a victim of abuse and now i m afraid i m being the abuser my ex would constantly gaslight me every time we fought he tried to make it seem that what happened wa different and i misremembered it or that he meant something absolutely different or i didn t understand our argument would take hour and hour only to be emotionally exhausting and i could never win he wa also a compulsive liar in general even in the smallest thing and made me feel like i wasn t enough he made me develop a lot of insecurity and self image issue i thought i had buried when i wa a teen reading about abuse i realised what wa happening to me and i left that relationship with a lot of baggage and trauma and i shut myself completely from relationship for year until now now that i m dating someone else and thanks to my previous experience i recognised abuse in his ex and fought very hard for him to see it it took time and a lot of energy from both of u but he still sometimes go back blaming himself and giving her chance and i lose my temper and i make it about me that s because his ex said publicly that she wanted to mess with me or cause me some kind of trouble it wa a purposely ambiguous expression that i don t really know how to translate i m from argentina she s a person with aggressive tendency towards others and herself who constantly threatened him with self harm and suicide attempt to make him do what she wanted even to get sex from him after she broke up with him because she wanted to open the relationship and he didn t this happened for year after she broke up their relationship and when he told her he had started dating me she realized she had lost her power over him and became obsessed with our relationship he said that he had realised she wa abusive and that he never wanted to go back to her and i believed him but she managed to make him feel sorry for her again and i couldn t take it and i made it about me after what she had done it made me feel le important to him and i d had a really hard journey trusting him or anyone again after my own abusive experience but i think i m not being fair with his healing process and i m blaming him too much for having a harder time that me leaving behind his abuser i realized on my own and left and never went back but i should know it s not the same for everyone there s also this thing that every time i get angry at him for whatever reason not always relating to his ex he ha anxiety attack and i have to stop expressing what hurt me to comfort him now sometimes i m afraid to even express my discomfort to him at all because i feel terribly guilty about his anxiety attack every time and i don t know if he s unfair or i m unfair here he never get angry at me and i feel i m always angry at least in comparison i don t want to also i ve always had a big temper and i ve been trying to tame it because he s the opposite and get very hurt by it apparently i ve made progress i need some insight if i m being abusive i want to change it immediately and we re both going to seek therapy soon to be better to each other,1

leaving my emotionally abusive husband sorry long i am hoping for a bit of encouragement from people who have been in similar situation i guess feeling alone my husband and i have been married nearly 6 year we knew each other online for 7 year before that but i immigrated from canada to the u for him and we married within 90 day a is stipulated by u immigration law because i had known him 7 year and we had met in person multiple time for a week here week there it didn t feel too crazy in the beginning even before i had relocated i noticed small red flag regarding jealousy and control but at the time we were long distance he told me he had been cheated on in the past to excuse his behavior and i wanted to be empathetic to that so like so many here i just ignored the sign there were so many other positive drowning them out so charming kind better to me than any other guy i d been with up until that point he s very handsome and we liked similar music game similar lifestyle he wa never happy he continually revisited the same reasoning when we argued and soon the arguing grew more frequent surely if i just did this or if i would treat him this way or if i would in other word carry more of the emotional weight then surely he could be happy and each time i tried and each time it did not matter he wa still unhappy when we argued he would often exhibit a few different pattern gaslighting being in there for sure another favorite being mixing up the chronology of event so that he look more innocent in what happened if i tried to correct him on the order of event he would circle back to gaslighting mixing up the timeline until i wa confused and then he d say something like see you don t even know like a gotcha moment but it had been totally manufactured i would feel like i lost my memory of the incident when it had been so clear second earlier well in the last two year he s had 3 affair with two different girl lied about them up until it became clear i already possessed the information i wa asking but to this day refuse to tell me anything that it is clear i don t know about the affair and gaslit me the entire time that no he is not having affair no they didn t mean anything to him no they didn t do anything no he didn t say that he loved them which i have photo of the message proving he did during this time he ha multiple time accused me of having an affair with an old colleague whom i have not worked with in over 2 year i have never been unfaithful or even sent an untoward message in my marriage i even protected him through the first 2 affair and did not tell my friend or parent and therefore i had no emotional support and he denied it to me he ha also said he saw me out at the coffee shop near u with a man he can t identify and he can t supply any information about this supposed sighting lol it never happened he usually put these thing out there if he is backed into a corner about his affair and i m tryin to get him to see how hurtful they ve been to the marriage and to me it s like he is trying to even the playing field with concocted story the last 2 year have been a constant see saw of mad at me sweet and charming mad at me sweet charming mad at me let s get dinner mad again wonderful kind mad happy just like bizarre ups and down and seemingly unstable anyway after discovering his latest affair a few week ago i put some plan into hyperdrive i m terrified at how fast it s all moving i signed a lease i set up my utility today and basically starting to move this weekend but will likely move most stuff next weekend i m sad for my little dog he will miss his dog sister and cat sister husband s pet and his dad of course i will miss our yard now i will have to take my dog downstairs to pee instead of letting him out i will have le money since we are dual income no kid but he make more my life is getting harder but i didn t do anything wrong not claiming to be a perfect person but i didn t cheat or purposefully hurt him that suck i feel an internal struggle between one side that s taking all the action to force it and the other that s like whoa whoa whoa he can change just trying to ignore that side i know nobody outside of coworkers here in the u just my dog make it tougher to join club and whatnot if no one else can let him out and if they meet inside he can t come haven t filed for divorce yet just going to separate and get working on that after i m a legal perm resident so i saw an immigration atty and they said i should apply for citizenship but need not worry 34 year old and feel way too old for this to be happening anyone of similar age geographical situation claw your way back to a healthy state of mind and dare i say a healthy relationship later in life,1

i wa gang raped in a church parking lot on my birthday and my ex dumped me to cheat on me on my birthday he ha a religious name i m having trouble coping with this i wa hooking up with a guy i met on tinder for about half a year i ended up with a uti after our first hook up i didn t tell him out of respect for him because i didn t know him he blocked me after the first month he texted me after a month and asked me for head the next time i saw him i had my period so he asked to jack off on me he posted my sext on twitter but then posted tweet of his other hook ups i didn t know him at the time so i didn t speak up i wa also having problem with my period so i wa only able to give him head the next time i saw him then he asked me to borrow 50 because he wa getting kicked out then he ghosted me for 2 week i had 3 shitty hook ups where the guy all came too fast and left then he asks me for anal it wa very painful and we were in the car he also asked me for 20 i wa in an indescribable amount of pain for the next few day he didn t really take my pain seriously that night because he tweeted about getting head two day later i didn t tell him about how painful it wa because i wa even more hurt with his tweet he stood me up twice after asking me to pick him up and having me wait outside i picked him up again and my car stalled but he asked for head i wasn t comfortable anymore so he left me with the stalled car and blocked me that made me very depressed and i eventually found out it wa a trauma bond a couple month later i wa finally able to see him again but i didn t want to ask about money or the anal he came really fast the next month he asked me for head and to borrow money twice he blocked me again he texted me again a month later and we finally had sex twice i sent him a text that i wasn t having orgasm and that i got a uti i also sent him a text about how much i wa in love with him and his beauty made me cry of happiness at first he ignored it and blocked me but then he posted it on his twitter he asked me for head and a week later we got a motel but he asked me for pay for it and to give him 50 he finished really fast but he wanted to leave after even though i spent a lot of money on the motel he blocked me after and i tried to hang out with him again telling them that the text that he posted wa important because i wa having a lot of problem because i wa gang raped but he asked me for head again and blocked me again i wasn t ever able to get the affection that i really needed from him i wa very depressed and always thinking about him i wa very isolated in my room waiting for another chance from him because he said i wasn t giving him good head my dog died and it wa more depressing that i had to reach out to my ex even though we were only hooking up i also told him it wa almost my birthday where i wa gang raped i sent him money thinking he would help me instead he tweeted on my birthday i sent him an email explaining my sexual assault in detail and that he hurt me with anal and the entire month he talked about strip club and wanting to hook up off tinder he also tweeted when he had sex but didn t have an orgasm he left me and had sex with someone else after telling him i wa gang raped then after i begged him for another chance he asked me to give him head again he blocked me and make fun of my text on twitter when it s my genuine love for him he s even posted a sex tape of his friend where he make fun of them slapping a girl as too hard this bother me because he s completely ignoring that he hurt me rectally this is hard for me because i love this person and everything about them hurt except for time they ve held my hand when i give them head i ve never felt so emotional about simply holding someone s hand before i m always affectionate with him even telling him about my foot fetish and calling him daddy i did call him and text him a lot telling him about my feeling but i never wanted him hate me for it it s really hurting to remember my gang rape on my birthday with what he did especially because of my history with him he hurt me physically so why would he want to hurt me on my birthday where i wa gang raped i would like more than normal advice because i understand how serious it is but i still feel depressed about him i don t feel close to anyone personally my heart still life for him when i already felt like giving up in the world it s the heartache that come with it,1

i 943f heard something i should not have when my daughter s 17f boyfriend 17m slept over for the sake of better understanding i will call my daughter abby and her boyfriend jay jay and abby met when they were 10 a a result of our relationship with their parent from then on they want to the same school and grew their friendship and have been dating for a year i am a little protective so even tho i allow jay to come for occasional sleepover i don t allow them to have sex at all and they did not for the most part it would have been kind of obvious in our house anyway a couple day ago jay came to sleep over and i decided to do the last check on my daughter and i hate to admit it but i stayed by the door an hour after everyone went to sleep and eavesdropped to check if there were any inappropriate sound i didn t hear that but i heard them talking and it sounded pretty intimate and vulnerable in a way so i decided to listen a little longer to what my daughter had to say they talked about a couple thing i didn t like because i thought it wa too soon buying their house having kid and the like along those line they were talking about how to raise their future child and abby said she would show the kid her utmost love because she didn t feel that growing up jay also went through many experience but my concern wa about abby abby said i never truly showed her love and it wa always just kind of doing my job because i brought her in to this world type of thing abby said many other thing and started cry and jay wa very loving and comforted her which made me very happy but i feel inadequate to have my daughter say that especially since i never sensed a problem do you think i should talk to her about it how do i go from here tl dr my daughter and her boyfriend were having a heart to heart talk that i overheard it made me rethink some thing sorry for the title error im 43f,0
just met this guy le than two week ago and am already seeing abusive pattern we met where i currently work it s a seasonal job and we both live on site about 30 step from each other we went to a bar the second night i wa here and he quickly became very forward about his interest in me and i wa stoked because he s pretty attractive and is sort of someone of importance where we work we laughed had good conversation etc it felt natural over the next few day he became obsessed and possessive saying i m his we re dating now i can t be with anyone else etc constantly coming to my room giving me the best most compliment i ve ever been given telling me we re going to travel together buy a house in whatever town etc fast forward to now he yell at me constantly i mean he ll have major freak out that scare me and will apologize soon after i ll be talking about something in my day and he ll tell me he doesn t want to hear me talk about thing unless i have a solution for them meanwhile i m a sounding board for his complaint annoyance all day he us my age to try to make me feel stupid i m 22 and he s 36 which is strange to begin with he s always gaslighting me but then he flip this switch and becomes funny and charming again i dunno it all feel very manipulative and controlling and weird after 13 day of knowing each other unfortunately i think that because of my childhood alcoholic absent parent abuse etc i feel strangely attracted to this behavior which i m ashamed to admit prior to recently i had been in a 4 year relationship with someone with zero abusive tendency so i never really had to face my self sabotaging relationship drama seeking self in the way of emotional abuse and i ve been questioning his behavior over the past few day a far a if he actually show those sign typing it all out pretty much give me my answer what suck is that we live so close to each other and i really haven t made good friend with anyone else thanks for letting me air this out,1
my 24m mother 44f started a sexual relationship with my father s employee 21m how can you help me solve it the text is quite long but i did my best to summarize a detailed a possible hope you can take the time to read and offer advice amp x200b we are an armenian family living in california we moved here from armenia in the late 90 s because my father had bought a business company here in

started to argue and not agree often i had a good relationship with one of my father s employee scott he wa younger than me he worked a an accountant for dad he wa incredibly smart dad wanted to give him more responsibility within the company because he wa a good worker and reliable dad invited him to dinner every friday at our house my mother had started going on a course to get a license so she could start helping dad with the family business the problem wa that mom didn t have a driver s license and we couldn t drive her to the course all the time dad decided to let scott drive mom to the course and with that he didn t have to work in the company so much so scott spent monday to friday every week with my mom because he drove her to the course and back home mom also had errand that she used to go to after the course so he spent those time with her a well and that wa their daily routine he picked up mom from the house early in the morning and left her home at night all the time i thought he wa strangely nice because he didn t have to do this he wa already the company s accountant and had much else to think about than driving around my mom in march of this year i dad and five other employee went on a work trip to tokyo it wa about business and agreement mom would stay home and dad didn t want to leave her alone in the house because he wa afraid of robbery burglary and other thing it wasn t safe for a woman alone scott wa willing to live in the house with mom until we come back from the trip we would be there for 27 day in the middle of the work trip i saw a picture

the couch with crossed leg and lightly dressed the caption wa cozy with the best which i thought wa strange here it started to feel a little strange and uncomfortable because it wa late at night and

bother to greet mom he walked into his room to do some paperwork i greeted mom at the door she wa going out to eat with scott this is what it looked like mom and scott started to spend the day

alone mom and dad s relationship got worse dad wa involved in his work thing were bad for the company he took out all the anger on mom everything led to dad divorcing mom mom felt bad and had a hard time scott tried to make her feel better take her out comfort her invite her to food shop and other thing my girlfriend minar and i tried to spend a lot of time with my mom to show her that we are there that we are there for her but mom wa hard to comfort it felt like scott wa the only one who could make her smile sometimes i didn t know why so i asked him myself to take an absence from his work and the company to spend time with my mother he agreed dad took the house because it wa on his name he told me that i wa allowed to stay there but that my mother could not stay in the house

any one have experience against abuser and stalker that us a private investigator when the other person ha a lot of money time and hire a rogue private investigator pi to help stalk you and figure out where you work and invade your privacy don t know how much detail i will post but want to know if any one else faced this hardship and how you went about living your life while trying to evade and retailate against a private investigator too what legal recourse is there if the pi know you re going to police and doesn t care about ethic they still work around that pi then us information from public record and any police report filed against them to workaround the police and evade legal action it also seems harder for city police to take action against a liscensed pi then against a normal person so the stalker just basically hide behind a pi,1

how do i heal myself from this hello this is quite a lengthy post and thanks in advance for anyone who can read and offer advice i recently left my partner after thing got so bad i feel like the past year and 6 month ha all been a lie he made me question what is real and not because of his continuous lying amp general not giving a fuck behavior the thing is i knew when i got with him he wa a gambling and coke addict i could or so i thought see him working at those thing especially in the beginning though and a he led me to believe so i thought we could work thing out when he gambled i would bail him out time and time again worth noting his mother also totally enables him by lendjng him cash every month which meant every month when he got paid it would be a vicious cycle of being paid paying part of the debt from month before not having enough for the next month and then borrowing more money and the cycle continued he in our whole year and a half took me out for a date once we were stuck inside the house most of the time because if we went out i would need to pay for it and add it to his never ending list of debt to me i ve written off around 3500 worth of debt that he owes me we are both quite fiery people expecially where alcohol is involved i tend to get quite loud and shouty whilst he ha progressively become more physical which ha meant ive retaliated at time and got physical back just need to point out he get physical and leaf mark bruise if i hit him back it nothing on him and just encourages him more to hurt me more one day he and i stayed up drinking all night i wa off work the next day he got cocaine and even when i had went to bed he stayed up taking it and watching tv the next day he wouldnt wake up for his alarm he wa already on a last warning from work about not turning up for work and phoning in sick if he lost this job which i helped him get then i would be the one saving his as and paying the fucking bill again so i shouted at him to get up or phone his bos to explain he wont be in he turned to me and grabbed me by the neck and choked me against the bed and told me to shut the fuck up when he got off me i slapped his arm and said what the fuck are you fucking doing he then turned and did it again i have had to phone the police one time because he accused me of meeting someone on tinder when i wa actually sat in my big sister house when i got home and confronted him about it thing escalated horrifically i thought he wa going to kill me i phoned the police and he ran in and grabbed my phone off me and threw it out the 3rd story window i had to get that phone repaired he then did a similar thing recently on new year even which meant i had to have it repaired again 200 down the drain but he doesnt fucking care his mum saw the bruise and asked me about them but didnt say a thing to him he been in and out of court jail for drug problem is when he not acting like an absoute lunatic he is the loveliest person but it so up and down and short lived i know the next drama or problem is just around the corner in these past 6 month he ha stole money from me around 350 gambled all of his earnings twice got into cocaine debt with a dodgy dealer physically and emotionally abused me spat on my face financially took total advantage of me this time round he owes me around 1600 that im not writing off ha never bought a single thing for our home always expects me to do it why the fuck do i still love him why can i not stop thinking about someone who treat me like this why am i only ever remembering the time when he wa sweet and lovely now from my side im not perfect i have quite bad paranoia and can have a sharp tongue i can say nasty thing when i have my back up and defensive mix that with the fact he ha a tendency to bareface lie and cover his track every time he doe something wrong it ha made me not trust him and made me really put my guard up with others at all my paranoia these past month have been in over drive that i had convinced myself he ha been cheating we actually met year ago at work and had an affair whilst he had a pregnant girlfriend at home which i didn t realise at the time because he failed to mention it this isnt the first relationship that i ve been paranoid about cheating though and is something i really need to work on with a therapist ive felt myself going insane and not being myself to the point where ive also lashed out and did some crazy thing such a phoning his work friend when he refused to come home to me and his son and i tried to convince them to try and get him to come home of course they all just thought i wa nut though i could feel myself going insane which now im out of it i realise i had over reacted cause i wa caught up in this mental life and bubble that he had created anyway ive left i have left alot of our furniture that we said we would split the cost for but a usual i paid for it and he is still paying me back im tempted to go back and get it all and leave him in the empty den of a home that he hasnt bothered to create is that petty he still owes me money and im worried if i do that now he wont give me any of my money all in all doe this sound like im dealing with someone who is out and out an abusive horrible person or doe it sound like the product of addiction wa i also abusive by wanting him to get his shit together and prioritise the important thing his son me his family and his financial commitment and by being paranoid wa this also abusive on my side how do i personally just move past it what really helped you guy ha anyone else suffered this sort of paranoia anxiety how do i learn to trust again sorry laying all card on the table here im just desperate to stop thinking about him and get my life back,1

help in an emotionally abusive relationship not sure if i am also emotionally abusive a well or if i am being manipulated and gaslit i apologize in advance i didn t mean for this to be so long but i ve been holding this all in for 5 year with no one to talk to even if no one read this it felt good letting it out i m 32 f yr old and have been in a relationship with my partner 38m for 5 year of course it started out great between u and i really thought we were soulmates and meant for each other i thought reconnecting after 25 year parent were best friend when we were child wa a sign it wa meant to be now it is not so great and thing are terrible he ha been in and out of jail for the entire duration of our relationship i thought with enough love nurturing and understanding that thing could change for the better i now realize this wa the wrong way to think and am now aware that people only change when they are ready and wanting to there were time we would have disagreement and he would leave not answer my call text ignore me for day it didn t matter how many time i explained to him that respectful communication wa important to me and even went a far a telling him i have abandonment issue from childhood and it throw my anxiety out of whack when i don t hear from him for hour or day is this an insecurity of mine or is this abusive and controlling behaviour i wa so in love with him for the first 2 5 year that i would always forgive him i thought if we just talked thing out and i reminded him of how much i loved and cared for him that he would care understand and treat me better he promised the name calling shoving threat of harm and threat of suicide would stop and never happen again because he realized how much he hurt me he would make it better all i had to do wa wait a few more day and he would get his head straight and be ready to give me the world like i deserved of course this behaviour never stopped thing only got worse 5 year later and i m still waiting is this narcissistic behaviour this is just a small picture of my relationship to sort of give you an idea of where thing began i would really like help with the following i began distancing myself emotionally a few month ago when i found out my partner wa chatting calling random woman on social medium non sexual while i wa going through a very depressive and suicidal bi polar episode at the time i also had a broken heart and extremely broken spirit from previous action and behaviour during this relationship this wa the first time he had spoken to random woman i don t and never have had a problem with him having female friend and i felt and still feel like he stepped out of our relationship why would he give his attention to another woman when i wa always a phone call away waiting to hear his voice and wanting to talk about our day and make thing better between u why did he not want attention from me when i gave him the world what did these other woman have that i didn t why couldn t he be there for me and make me feel better and help me get out of the depression i wa feeling of course because i wa in a very depressed state this all spun out of control into a deep

i wa yelled at everything i told him wa lie because it didn t make sense every time i tried to bring up how he never believed me he said that wasn t true i started to keep a list and he got mad at me for that everyone else told him the truth but me i wasn t allowed to tell anyone the truth about him though i got screamed at whenever i did even though it wa just to my own family every friend i had wa a threat i had no one in the end our last argument wa because i wore earring and saw my best friend i had almost no one to turn to because i consistently chose him over everyone he grabbed me once i hit him back i cried all night about it he pushed me into a table while we were out to eat with his friend because he wa mad at me i excused myself and cried in the bathroom i got yelled at that his friend weren t my friend at all i couldn t have my own and i couldn t have his i could have him he yelled at me for cry too loud one night saying he could hear me in the other room through the wall he yelled at me during every fight to leave then when i would try he would say i m giving up while cry his eye out and begging me to stay he always told me that i wasn t a good person and that i let people walk all over all the time he got mad when i didn t mention him within the first few sentence of me meeting someone because i wa trying to hide him he also got mad when i would avoid confrontation at work because i have to see those people six day a week i got yelled at by him because a coworker sexually assaulted me it wa my fault in his eye i have depression so my memory of event wa sometimes skewed i wa accused of purposefully forgetting aspect of situation to make him look bad and when i actually did remember thing i got yelled at because how could i given my horrible memory and now the girl i went to after the break up and told everything to the girl that knew i had no one else but her because of him she s dating him now,1
is mutual abuse a myth this is a long one with a lot of background information for context ultimately i don t know who is in the wrong i assume it s both of u i don t know my background i am now 27 transgender mtf i wa born and raised in omaha ne until i wa 14 my parent divorced at age 8 mom remarried and moved to oregon i went with her my mom and dad fought all the time a far a i remember it wa only verbal arguing my mom wanted another kid and considered leaving him until he agreed to conceive my brother my dad rightfully didn t trust my mother she cheated on him for several year with who would become my stepdad this started when my dad wa reluctant to have my brother but also he yelled at her a lot and wa very mean red in the face etc i didn t face much abuse growing up besides being yelled at a lot and very rarely poorly disciplined in what now is considered abusive method spanking and punishment of the like i moved to portland from a small town when i wa 19 and soon met my ex wife i never had a long term relationship before and i lost my virginity to her i didn t transition until the end of the relationship but i did start to show sign towards the beginning her background she is the same age a me wa born only a few week after me ci female she wa born in washington state but moved to west oregon with her mother her mother and father are divorced the father allegedly which i believe sexually abused her sister when they were very young the mom left and they moved to western oregon the mother quickly remarried and joined the jehovah s witness when the mother got remarried the stepdad put her and her sister in the care of his father for a week or two for their honeymoon during this time i wa told that she and her sister were sexually abused by this man the mother ha shitty judgment the older sister outed him they were still very young and the mother never reported it at the request of the quack in their congregation but at least she had enough sense to keep my ex and her sister away from that monster my ex ran away from her home and the religion at age 19 and moved in with a girl she grew up with who also left the religion and her soon to be husband our background the relationship started very well she wa hooking up with a friend in college and he just bailed one day never to be seen again i wa slightly acquainted with her and thought she wa cute she came over one day to see her buddy only to find that he moved she wasn t sad the guy cheated on his gf with her and she confronted the gf to apologize she wasn t aware she soon met me for real and we hit it off quickly she took my virginity and soon we were a couple after dating for a few month i proposed to her and she said yes during the early day of our relationship she advocated u having 3 way at first i wa reluctant but soon became open to is and even arranged one to happen we had another with her friend and then we kept our relationship closed for quite a while at this time i started crossdressing my ex thought it wa hot and so did i she later became concerned that i wa gay a in attracted to men since at the time i identified a male after being married for a couple of year my ex wife became attracted to our friend female we agreed that we would date her during this time i developed a crush on a friend of mine male one of the only few that i ve ever been attracted to and later came out to my wife and girlfriend a bi i now identify a lesbian leaning pan bi my ex wife and girlfriend thought that wa hot and encouraged me to find a guy to be with i tried and only fooled around a little bit after about a year of dating our friend she dumped u for a guy she met at the job we all worked at yeah i know and then my ex wanted to close our relationship i agreed after a couple of unsatisfying attempt to meet guy so the relationship is closed and we continue to be a couple for the next couple of year at this point i started struggling more with my gender identity and began posting in support group online and i began calling out of work a lot to stay home and try being female alone in a non sexual way just being home a a woman of course i demonstrated suspicious behavior because i didn t want her to know i wa considering transitioning she thought it wa just a fetish because of having a history with including other people in our relationship we began to develop trust issue she had left town for a day or so to see her sister and i took that day a an opportunity to soul search and dive deep into my mind i took 7 acid and seriously considered my life a a woman and a a man and i concluded that i wanted to be a woman i cried a lot and posted a picture of me presenting a female with a long come out post in that group when my ex returned she eventually went through my phone and found that post she cried but not because she didn t want me to transition but because i didn t tell her first she supported me finding access to hrt hormone therapy and gave me clothes of hers that she thought i would like and helped me acquire new stuff of my own the abuse before i continue the story i would like to note that the first instance of physical abuse wa once early in the marriage she pushed me against a wall during an argument i got scared and cried a lot and she cried too and profusely apologized for doing that to me nothing like that happened until the end of summer 2017 where the story continues at this time i wanted validation a a woman i started posting lewd photo in facebook group about trap which i now know is an offensive term and is descriptive of crossdressers not transwomen some people told me i wa hot some called me a man i didn t how to feel one of the guy who thought i wa hot started messaging me and he wa very validating in my mind i started to flirt back i wa careful about this and kept it from my ex for a month or two she became suspicious a i wa sure to make sure she didn t see my message one day after work i fell asleep on the living room floor i woke up to a big kitchen knife in my face and my ex wife yelling who is anthony she then threatened the knife on herself after threatening me i seized the knife from her and i told her the story i apologized she asked me if i needed the relationship to be open and said that i did she wa sad but willing to try to make it work i thought i might be bi or even strictly into men at this point but it turned out i just wanted the validation we tried to find a guy together with little success after the knife incident thing kind of calmed down until the beginning of 2018 at the beginning of the year our cat got sick we didn t know what wa wrong with her we were struggling financially too and had to resort to a charity vet to save our cat s life to make end meet i suggested that we move in my ex s friend and coworker who i wa iffy about at best from the beginning this woman had been a friend of ours since the summer of 2018 this woman wa the worst though sure she covered a 300 gap in the rent we needed but she wa a princess she would get irritated at anything she would lock me out to bang dude in our living room at this time i started a new job at a call center which turned out to be a scam i wasn t paid for the week of work i did and found another job i wa unemployed for 3 week and got unemployment check the friend of ours called me a leech off the government because she didn t understand the concept of unemployment insurance and put me down for being jobless even though i wa already in the hiring process elsewhere she began to randomly rip my wig off call me a man etc i hated this person so much once i wa hired i had little time to attempt to retrieve the paycheck owed to me so my ex wife took it upon herself to harass the guy online which i did at first then gave up the roommate that s what i ll call her she wa never a friend of mine or my ex s started telling my ex that since they re doing all the work to get my paycheck that they should be entitled to it _ _ so our relationship wa strained from all of that soon after that i matched on a dating app with a friend i hadn t seen in year he transitioned female to male so i thought we might have common ground again my ex and i agreed to be open but she wa reluctant to it i went to go see my friend ended up just being friend and stayed with him a day this same person is also the first person my ex and i had a 3 way with my ex and i soon went to dinner a couple of day later and mutually broke up we decided that it would be best to be friend the next day i went back to my friend s place for 3 or so day in a row until i had work again at this time my ex and the succubus we allowed to live with u managed to get the shitbag employer who owed me to pay me he sent 700 via facebook my ex then got into my facebook and transferred it to our joint account and seized the money before i came home her justification wa that she didn t believe i would pay rent she thought i wa going to bail and move in with my trans friend which i wa not planning to do i just wanted to be away from the abusive roommate for awhile when i got home i demanded my money and an argument broke out between the three of u she agreed to give me half and the roommate butted in saying that i m lucky to get that like it wa hers or something i believed the rest of the money wa in her backpack i went for the backpack at the same time a my ex and we struggled over the backpack pulling back and forth causing u to fall on the bed next to u i tried to pull it out of her hand and the roommate bitch called the police and made said i wa attacking them i wa mad gave up on the backpack threw my make up bag across the room i wa going to purpose the money towards my transition and they both knew that because i mentioned it before this i told them they were horrible people for stealing from my transition fund and said that they should kill themselves for being such awful people the cop showed up the roommate said that i threatened to kill them and claimed i stomped on her foot which i did not do and walked with a faked dramatic limp i wa then arrested the court tried to stack charge against me menacing harassment harassment and assault 4 my public defender wa great though but it wa my intuition that kind of saved me i wa only convicted of menacing the roommate had a criminal history of her own for stealing dv and ha a record of being dishonest in court i knew this because she bragged about it so i looked up her record and presented them to my lawyer the da though who i believe only care about conviction rate dropped all the charge but menacing in a plea agreement or good luck fighting all four charge so i got shafted pretty bad got labeled an abuser and sentenced to 18 month probation if you don t want to believe me that is fine but i did not strike anyone in this incident i didn t stomp on the roommate s foot and i didn t threaten to kill anyone but i did tell them to kill themselves and threw an adult temper tantrum i will admit guilt where it is due though i didn t mention this in the story before because my memory of the end of our relationship is foggy but before the incident i just described my ex hit me on a few separate occasion in the arm and or pushing me in addition to the abuse of the roommate one time i did hit her back in the arm and bruised it i ve read up a little before posting this and it seems that mutual abuse is a myth at least according to public opinion but i still feel bad about hitting back i feel that i am guilty of that and telling her to kill herself it been nearly 2 year since from the incident an 18 month restraining order wa put in place so i had to move in with my friend for a bit the restraining order is over but the trial wa delayed quite a bit so my sentence end in just over 2 month from now i had no supervision no drug test i smoke weed and drink sometimes no gps no this or that the only condition is no contact with the victim and i had to take an 8 hour anger management class boom done the aftermath so after staying a few month with my friend i relocated to my parent in washington then i came back to portland in july and stayed there until a couple of week ago i tried to find work but i couldn t before i ran out of place to stay i am back at my parent employed and hoping to come back soon while i wa back in portland though mutual friend told me that the roommate ended up stealing from my ex she got kicked out the roommate would drink at work even back when i wa around and stole shit from work apparently ex and i dated for a year started working where they worked and reported the roommate for being a drunk and a thief she got canned i guess that s some cosmic irony if any apparently myking pretty negatively about me until this happened which wa early in the summer from what i gathered that s it for now i guess so ultimately what i want to know is whether or not mutual abuse is a myth at time we were both pretty shitty to each other i know that i am certainly a victim even though the law would say otherwise i believe that she is a victim too though should i feel guilty for reacting the way i did should i feel forgiveness towards her because i do at least now i wa quite vindictive for quite a while even to the point about bragging about the roommate stiffing her too it wa just recently that i realized that in my opinion we were both victim of the roommate s plot to use u financially feel free to ask whatever,1
what s wrong with me i sometimes want to go back to my the guy who abused me i m with a new guy now who is so sweet and caring and it honestly took a while to get used to because i wasn t accustomed to being treated nicely so it sort of put me off in the beginning but i m getting a lot better because i really want it to work but my fucked up brain sometimes miss the guy i used to be with and he treated me like shit so shit what the fuck is wrong with me also i usually start to miss want to go back to the old guy when i start feeling alone depressed not mentally well i just wanna run back for some reason like when i feel like everyone hate me and i have no one i just wanna go back i m so stupid,1

i 30 f am dating a guy 31 m with kid and i m not sure if this is normal small background info i dated this guy around 7 year ago but life threw u into two separate direction and we broke up and lost touch between then and now he wa in a relationship with another woman and they ended up having a kid about 3 year ago thing didn t work out with them and he s been single and co parenting for over a year i came back to town about 4 month ago and we reconnected it s been pretty casually until last week when he took me to dinner and asked if we could be something more i wa a bit nervous because i ve never dated someone with a kid before and voiced my concern he wa great and answered all of them so i said sure let s try it again he told me that him and his daughter s mom had planned on going to a theme park on saturday and asked me if i had a problem with that i don t i understand wanting to making mom and dad memory with your kid and they seem to be co parenting very well my problem wa that i wa ghosted the entire weekend no text no call nothing now i don t expect constant message because i get he s with his daughter and the park can be crazy but i didn t hear from him for two day just a simple hey miss you would suffice is this normal i wanted to bring it up to him but i m not sure the right way to do it if we re dating i don t want to be treated like i don t exist when he s with his kid and her mom i get not wanting to maybe be texting me in front of the mom but i also don t want to be a secret so extra thing that are on my mind during this his ex know about me but doesn t know we re dating she knew me from our first break up 7 year ago and she s the one who ruined their relationship but she keep trying to get back together with my guy i trust him fully but i ve never seen him interact with her so my trust is still there but it s not a strong a of it wa with a stranger that bond because of their kid is uncharted territory for me i met his daughter once on accident when we were leaving for a date and his parent were watching her she s super sweet and adorable but i won t officially meet her again until we ve been dating for a year their rule not mine and i m okay with that but i think her mom should know that he s seeing someone especially if he wa the one to approach me about the relationship but that s my opinion i could be wrong tl dr dating a new guy who ha a kid we defined the relationship and then he ghosted me the entire weekend because he wa co parenting or with his kid is this normal should i talk to him about not wanting to be a secret to his daughter s mom,0

after 20 year of alcohol drug abuse i m35 have finished rehab and come home to i don t know my wife f33 or myself anymore if i ever did we have been together 19 year since we were in high school we have 2 boy 15 and 12 married for 15 year like the title say i hit a low crashed my car really badly i have no memory of this and woke up in the hospital once i wa released from the hospital my wife gave me the ultimatum i had expected get sober or get a divorce i begrudgingly entered rehab and wa in residential treatment for 20 day i cam home october 15th i have been home for a while now and i have learned much to my horror that i really don t know my wife at all i have never known her sober and i know shamefully little about her i have never been with my kid with a clear head and worst of all i really really don t know myself really at all either it kind of drive u all crazy because my wife and kid are being careful not to put me in a situation where i might want to use drink again i am being careful because it like being with stranger all the time and i really don t know how or what is appropriate fun something they enjoy needle to say we have been at home quite a bit and it put tension on u my question is how do i proceed and move forward how can i re connect with my family when i am a totally different person than i ever wa when i created my family i guess i am just reaching out for help because now i have no friend they all used no close family my addiction burned all the bridge i had left and no one else i can turn to for advise at this point in my life i know my therapist said struggle like this would happen and i need to be ready for them and that i needed to find a therapist to continue my progress well i live in a one stoplight town literally and i have seen one therapist but we did not jive not only because she wa a 2 hour drive each direction away i am looking in other nearby community but right now nothing ha worked out tl dr got sober now i don t know my family anymore or myself,0
advice for a person with narcissistic tendency my father is a narcissist and i believe i picked up many of his trait growing up in relationship i desperately try to give my partner the space she need and the trust she deserves but i often find my insecurity overwhelming my rational thought pattern doe anybody have any tip on how to let go of the need for control or have any story of what ha possibly helped their partner in the past my partner and i are far from an abusive relationship so i hope this isn t met too harshly or seem insensitive if there is a better sub for this question and you know of it i would gladly take my question there my fear is just that my behavior could escalate and i love my partner too much to let that happen without at least trying to change i don t believe i am a narcissist but sometimes the way i think make me convinced otherwise i have worked pretty hard since i wa about 15 to try to reverse some of these pattern with some success but still struggle sometimes thank you,1
is this an abusive relationship my 32 f and 44 m boyfriend have been together for ten year and thing have started going down hill fast he is self employed and i stay home to take care of the house dog etc i do not have a job and no child only in the past couple year since we moved ha it really gotten bad we argue every day over something and no matter what i do it s never enough recently he ha started talking down to me because i don t make any money even though he doesn t want me to have a job every thing i do ie if i drink a beer he ll say oh enjoy that free beer etc he is self employed and is gone 4 5 day a week pretty much all day i literally don t go anywhere i don t have a license but could easily get one i just know he doesn t want me to have one or go anywhere if i go to town with a friend he accuses me of everything under the sun and it s just not worth it i have suspicion he is cheating on me and is definitely hiding some thing from me when i confront him or accuse him he get extremely angry call me some pretty bad name and leaf this is almost a daily fight now and ha gotten physical on both our side and some pretty nasty thing said we rarely have sex i cannot talk to him about anything especially my feeling we literally have never gone on a date and he won t take me out in public he say he can do whatever he want and it s none of my business and won t tell me anything about where he is or what he doing this ha only really been past two year but past 6 month or so pretty bad i love him and our dog and animal but it is starting to take a toll on me and don t know what to do anymore i m not sure if i m being paranoid about him cheating or not but i think after ten year you could at least tell someone what your doing for the day instead of saying fuck off i ll do whatever i want i m totally lost and don t know what to do,1

suicidal and a a friend i offed support and companionship one day i wanted them to feel better they had a family issue so i stepped in brought drink and made there day a little better showed them my favorite place in the city and they made there move and it went on from there them being suicidal and suffering from depression should have been a red flag but i ignored the sign because how amazing their personality wa a our relationship grows we tried hare to make it work they always made it how clear that i m not there type that i m younger shorter and made point of my body issue it wa harmless until they started using drug which ive been ordered to facilitate under the excuse of them needing it to function after i convinced them to start working and urn then own money i tried to make them stop it and decrease dos after they had enough of their bos i tried getting them a job at my cosine mead company but they couldn t get the job although they found a another job they would make me spend my day after work with them at their new job to support them emotionally l stopped going home for a while and that creates problem with my family especially when they didn t get the job at the medium company they made me contact my cosine dis they for not hiring them and pushed me further away from my family pointing out how badly they treated me and how no one respect me a a person and how much they have taken from me this wa all fine until they had a problem talking about a person defaming them they caught wind of that the person made a huge mess and wanted to fight them i tried to mediate but it got worse i m not a confrontational personal i tried to stay out of it they quit their job immediately and made me cut tie to everyone involved and quite my job a well so we

cosine told her how much i hate her call her a cheater and a narcissistic bitch and more they fabricated a whole story around fact and problem i have had for a long time and blamed her for it then they text my mom ousting me for taking money from there bank account and selling some jewelry and my electronics i needed the money to support their drug addiction and accused me of taking these drug so my whole life unfolded i had a talk with my brother he convinced me everything will be fine and he s glad that i m out so after a a couple of day i tried to go on dating site and when i came back

i just realised that my abusive ex wa perhaps a pedophile i m well aware i may be in denial over this but i need some of you guy to tell me straight up is 16 considered underaged to clear thing up i wa in a 1 year relationship with a 21 year old man when i wa 16 we knew each other in real life through a sport club and he is well aware of my age before we got together he wa the one to ask me for the relationship which i foolishly said yes to during that period i wa a devout catholic and told him straight up that i m not into sexual stuff until marriage and all that jazz but somehow in some way like how crashing wave can chip off the strongest of cliff he wore me down with what i have realised over these past few year to be psychologically and emotionally manipulative behaviour guilting blaming extreme possessiveness etc before i knew it i caved in and wa giving him sexual favour almost everyday it grew to the point where i wa dreading the end of our date because that wa when i knew i had to do it to him thank god i snapped out of it before it got down to real sex though but it wa a close call too close i am well aware that i wa groomed during the period of the relationship to sexually please him i have never really thought about the screwed up thing that happened during the course of the relationship to me it wa just any other toxic relationship and then came the revelation when i told a close friend of mine and she said these word to me isn t 16 underaged though doesn t that make him like a pedo or something i made this post to ask you guy a dumb a it sound if 16 is underaged even after googling that the legal age is 18 i really don t know why but 16 just doesn t seem like a minor age to me maybe because i really don t want what my close friend said to me to be true,1

littlest of thing that would anger him like not having his clothes out and ready for work or not being able to wake him up in the morning to go to work but he didn t hit me he would throw the clean laundry out of the laundry room throwing it all over the kitchen floor kicking everything around looking for the sock he needed then he would leave it for me to pick up but he didn t hit me he would get right in my face screaming at me telling me he could easily kill me and hide my body where it would never be found then he d spit on me to get his point across and spit on the floor because he knew i would have to clean it up but he didn t hit me he would sit with his loaded 45 sitting in his lap or pointed it at me or my head telling me if i ever lied to him again he promised he d kill me

become super angry but he didn t hit me he would make me ask before leaving to go place before seeing my family and i had to text him a soon a i left and a soon a i got somewhere i would have to answer his call right away when i wa gone or it would make him angry and he would threaten to hurt me but he didn t hit me he would get angry when i had to ask my family for money to make sure our electric wasn t shut off or when i would go to the food bank to make sure my baby always had something to eat he said i wa making him look bad for doing those thing for always putting the kid before him he would scream that he d leave me if i kept doing those thing promised to kill me or make sure he got custody of the kid but he didn t hit me he would point the gun at his head say that he would kill himself because i made him depressed and hate his life he would make me cry and beg for him to not kill himself a he screamed at me to shut the f ck up bitch but he didn t hit me he would fall asleep in bed sleeping on his gun so he always had it on him i would cry myself to sleep wondering when i would be killed i d beg him to shoot me in the chest so i could have an open casket for the

i 37f don t want to have sex with husband 38m who say sex is most important thing in relationship i see a lot of post by people who say that their partner doesn t want a much sex a they do and the tension it creates so it s hard to admit that i am the one holding out in my relationship a bit of context my partner and i have been together 6 year sex wa amazing and plentiful at first then we got pregnant unexpectedly after 2 year we figured we could make a family work so we had our son after his birth very long and traumatic for me my sex drive disappeared not dwindled completely left i had zero interest in sex and wa completely overwhelmed by having a kid i felt like i died that first year of his life while my partner stood beside and watched it happen he helped out when he wasn t at work but i did the bulk of the load and our son wa a very difficult baby i chalked up my lack of interest to the stress i wa under after about 6 month and many conversation about sex i decided to fake it till you make it which wa some advice i had heard we had sex a few time and every single time it wa horrible for me super painful super awkward and just overall extremely unenjoyable often ending with me cry it wa made worse by the fact that my husband clearly wanted it and i felt an obligation to provide him sometimes this wa my feeling and sometimes thus came from him i went to the dr and had an exam to see if there wa some physiological reason why it would be painful we tried lube different postions different sex act all of it feel gross i put out a much a i could to keep the relationship going but every time i wa basically dissociating to get through it and it didn t seem to be enough for him anyway that wa four year ago since then we had another child currently 5 month and bought a house we ve had good sex maybe 5 time in the 4 year but even then i don t orgasm i have no interest in masterbating or other people i feel completely dead inside and also so exhausted from taking care of the kid we are both miserable and full of resentment i have asked him to come to therapy with me i go every week but he is resistant i have bought book on relationship but he doesn t read them he actually lost one i ve told him i need more emotional connection to feel close to him but he say he need more sex to feel emotional so we are kinda stuck in a catch 22 i don t know what to do i feel stuck in the relationship and don t want to leave but can t keep going on like this any advice is welcome thanks tldr after having kid i no longer have a sex drive and it is making my relationship miserable for both of u,0
am i unfair to hold up my 34f end of expectation if my bf 45m changed his boyfriend and i together 3 year both have been married and have kid early on i made it clear i would not attempt to blend without a major show of commitment call it been here done that syndrome but i think i ve learned my lesson and now have my little one to look out for recently we decided to get a place that he moved into this summer and the plan wa i would move in when my lease wa up next spring this wa contingent on u getting engaged before then my daughter and i stay here all the time we re making a real effort at blending the kid and we ve hit a few snag with ex s etc but we re making progress we have been looking at ring discussing date and even have a trip to europe booked where my boyfriend said he wa going to be proposing this weekend we had a fight and we read he ha decided engagement is off the table for now i took a few day and came back and said while i completely understand that more time would be beneficial for u to work through stuff i will take the stuff i had so far moved in clothes and bathroom stuff and i ll be moving back into my place we ll continue to stay here periodically but because the term of what we discussed changed i d feel more comfortable in my own place until we have a clearer direction he is pissed to say the least i do not want to drag my daughter through a situation in 2 3 year where she s uprooted again and that sign of commitment is very important to me i m willing to put in the hard work now but not without that topic being on the table tdlr said i wouldn t move in officially until engaged boyfriend took engagement off table so i m moving back into my place,0
i really want to hit my bf sometimes ok here we go i am 21 f he is 27 m we have been dating a little over 1 5 year from the beginning of our relationship he would do really crazy thing mostly when he wa drunk like not wanting me to leave so he would throw my key in the yard and try to make me find them if i wanted to leave he ha always cornered me when he want to talk when i don t and one time he did get slightly aggressive and pulled the back of my shirt so it wa kind of choking me he felt really bad and ran off cry and saying he wa going to turn himself in he wa a bad person etc i calmed him down because to be honest it wasn t a big deal to me i understand everyone act out of anger sometimes but looking back it kind of wa a big deal i have never been a physical person before but sometimes he really brings out the worst side of me what he did today to really make me go off wa he kept slapping my butt i get that s playful or whatever but i repeatedly asked him to stop because it wa getting harder and harder and it hurt he wouldn t stop but he still though he wa messing around i wa trying to study and he wa just going on and on and then he said i ll leave if you give me a kiss which i get can be cute but i wa already annoyed so i wa like no i m studying please just go in the other room he kept slapping my butt and wa kind of leaning over me just going on and on about giving him a kiss so he will leave i know logically if i just gave him the kiss he would have been on his way but when i m annoyed i m not into physical affection and i just want him to do what i ask of him and leave anyways i wa so mad i grabbed his face and squeezed pretty hard and kissed him kind of it wa out of anger and he went into the other room calling me a c word he doesn t generally call name and saying i made his mouth bleed and he wa gushing blood he wa not he then said to leave i tried to he didn t let me repeat repeat and he just keep telling me i punched him which i didn t but i do understand i wa aggressive i m just not sure what to do i m not sure how to solve the anger that came over me that i have experienced and suppressed before if i should just leave the relationship or what a talk about boundary is necessary but those never seem to go anywhere please be kind,1
her father ruined my gf s christmas and i m fed up of his bullshit throwaway because gf know my reddit account she doesn t frequent r relationship however so i should be ok me m24 her f25 hey all ive got a bit of a conundrum so hopefully someone can give me some logical advice apology for the length side note if it s in quotation mark it s either a copy paste from messenger or a quote from the phone call background me and my gf have been together for nearly 4 year now and all is pretty good bar some fight and the usual tantrum from the both of u we are pretty damn solid and working on bettering ourselves losing weight saving money all those wonderful adult thing little under 2 year ago we moved away from her parent we were living with them during my last year of uni and got a place together near my parent who live around 8 hour away it wa mainly because of job opportunity were better here but having family nearby help her parent are imo a little old school they are quite controlling over what she doe and her father a military man push strength and again imo ha a kind of hatred towards weakness for example my gf suffers from depression get the pill ha therapy and is coping well her father say it all fake and she need to just stop being sad that always go down a treat another example she is not a small lady we are aware of our weight issue and are trying semi successfully to deal with them her parent method of dealing with this mom amp dad is to remind her at every opportunity how she is obese and that i m going to leave her at any moment i m not stop saying that i m not that fucking shallow there are others such a thing that happened when i didn t know her but i m trying to keep it to at least within the last 4 year and i don t want to just list issue the issue so for the last few year we have gone to our family for christmas she to hers and me to mine then new year s would be a switch up this year is no different she left a couple day ago now this in itself i m iffy about she doesn t exactly get to choose to go home or not it s demanded my mother ha offered for her to stay one year and i go the next but it seems to have gone by the wayside this year however it all went to shit for relevance sake i should probably say i m from the uk and we have recently had quite the controversial vote i don t care about the politics amp i won t name my opinion but basically her family have some strong political belief and hers don t exactly match up it cause tension she got home after a long flight and we had previously agreed that she d call me when she landed i m a middle aged woman at heart and i worry but i didn t get anything no problem she s probably busy 5 hour later and still nothing however a you may imagine i had been blowing up her phone a little by that time and i wa wondering what had happened turned out this is what happened she d arrived at the airport and been picked up by her brother who bar the odd pleasantly wa silent the entire ride about an hour when she get home everyone is pleasant and greets her apart from her father who merely sits there watching tv and say hi weird but ok so theyre all sitting in the living room having a chat while dad watch the news about the resent result when he turn to the rest to chat politics now i wasn t there so all ive got is her message but for brevity s sake ill round it up dad mom and bro are all talking about how much they like boris amp are glad he won gf say she doesn t and explains why and dad say something weird gt he said he would never love me if i wa with someone like jc and i wa like i don t love jc and he cut me off and wa like i would never love you i would send you out my house and never want to see you again this throw her off a little they talk some more now a little heated she won t tell me everything that wa said but it eventually degrades into him standing up and shouting gt i m fucking angry now you re making me fucking angry fuck off now i ain t gonna lie she may have set him off she can be damn spiteful when she want to be but this set her cry which only piss him off more this unfortunately ive seen before a he proceeds to tell her to stop cry and just scream at her which just make her cry more wonderful up to the point where she stand up to go to leave at which point he walk right up to her and square up to her like he gonna hit her and say gt dont you fucking lock horn with me in my own house i ll say what i fucking like to you and she run away lock herself upstairs and call me now i dunno what the fuck to do do i go there and bring her back she say she doesn t want to leave and they are better now apparently he said he wa snippy cu of lack of sleep no sorry mind the man doesn t apologize but i m really starting to hate this guy before it wa a mild dislike the odd sexist comment and racist joke sometimes at my expense i m scottish which in his eye mean i m a drunk ive talked to my parent about it so some extent but i just don t know if it s my place to out her family a complete asshole oh should point out that during that encounter the mother wa egging him on and brother just ignored the whole exchange she won t leave them and i won t force her to they are her family but they are fucking toxic or maybe that s just what some family are like feel wrong to say that but how the fuck would i know i dunno i m just looking for some advice or maybe someone with a similar situation feel like no matter what i do atm i m fucking something up tldr gf went home for christmas 8 hour away and a soon a she arrived got screamed at by her dad for political shit he pull this shit all the time i m fed up wtf do i do,0

is it normal to develop anxiety depression self doubt a long time after the relationship ended i 21m left my physically and emotionally abusive ex 22f just over a year ago initially after breaking up with her i didn t really think i wa in an abusive relationship it wasn t really until last summer that i fully realised the scope of the abuse and how bad it actually wa before her and even when i wa with her i wa a really confident person very sure of myself and that i could achieve my aspiration and definitely not an unhappy or anxious person now i feel different a lot of the time i don t really feel like myself anymore i am currently doing my master placement a research lab and i am honestly gripped with anxiety and a feeling of dread everyday to the point where i often don t come in or avoid task i genuinely never thought i would be like this i have never felt like this before in stressful situation i don t feel capable anymore and seriously question my worth doubt myself and feel useless usually when i do thing i enjoy it can help but sometimes i just want to lay in bed and do nothing and i have greater tendancy to want to get intoxicated purely for the sake of it but i am avoiding such behaviour i just wanted to know if anyone else ha experienced something similar last summer i did experience a couple of ptsd like flashback and a night terror but they stopped quite quickly and i didn t think i had any lasting psychological effect from the relationship i don t know why i feel like this it just doesn t feel like i feel this bad purely because i am finding my placement challenging a i never before approached stressful situation in this counter intuitive way ha anyone else felt this anxiety and self doubt after leaving an abusive relationship sorry for this being so long haha,1
i made an appointment for therapy it s been almost 6 year since we broke up i m now in a happy and healthy marriage yet i still can t get over this bullshit i woke up this morning in an absolute panic my heart wa pounding out of my chest and i couldn t breath all from a stupid dream i dreamt he wa trying to propose i screamed and cried and begged someone to stop him because i knew i had to say yes that i would be trapped for the rest of my life and i would end up killing myself to escape i woke up knowing it wasn t real and yet here i am dwelling on all of this and still feeling uneasy we haven t had any contact in almost 5 year why doe this still bother me so much i start therapy next week i need to get over this,1
you only want me for sex i know an unusual statement from a male abuser to his female partner but hear me out he say this whenever we break up hopefully this is the last time a a way to invalidate our six year relationship and call me selfish and loveless i try so hard to get u to do thing together but every single time he reject the plan last minute i clearly have not been invested for six year just for sex he disparages my sexual technique but when i ask for advice he say you should know i tried recently to do more pda to make him feel secure in our relationship that backfired apparently a he said it make him uncomfortable and then criticized me for not being affectionate at home he often sits away from me on the couch turn away from me in bed so how am i even supposed to display affection i am high libido and he is low libido although it may be entirely due to all the weed he smoke and so he feel justified in saying i only want sex meanwhile the only time he ever get really hot for me is makeup sex which is exactly the time i do not want to have sex after emotional trauma from fighting often involving aggressive action and verbal attack from him but i give in every time to repair the relationship but i only want him for sex,1

found out my 22f boyfriend 22m ha been lying about a video of me i have been dating this man who i trust and have adored for about 2 year now i m embarrassed to even be typing about this but i want outside opinion on the situation before i react here is the situation at the beginning of this semester my senior year of college mind you it started going around that there wa a video of myself that my boyfriend had taken of me without my knowledge or consent having sex on our spring break trip it wa sort of a he said she said so and so saw the video and a friend of mine wanted to let me know my boyfriend promised me this wa not true and that if it wa he would just tell me and he made it seem really silly that he would do something like that and then spread it i asked why would they lie then and he said he didn t know and he wa sorry that it wa even being brought up to me and even stu ally everyone stopped talking about it at least around me just because it wa really annoying for me it wa really hard for me and it took some time to believe him but i really did believe that it wa all just a misunderstanding anyways a good friend of mine who date one of my boyfriend s friend told me yesterday that the video had resurfaced and she said i think you would want to see it and i told her it wasn t me so i didn t need to see it and didn t want to she told me the video wa in a group chat with her boyfriend and a bunch of other guy she told me a soon a she saw her boyfriend watching it she told him that it wa not okay and that she wa telling me i appreciate her so much for this she ended up getting the video to me and before i watched the video my heart just sunk and i really hoped it wasn t me unfortunately it wa me and my boyfriend i remember the exact night it wa and it s a really personal video i had no idea he wa recording or anything and my face wa in the bed and he wa being really verbal with me and i wa being submissive for him and it s just really humiliating and i can t wrap my head around why he would do something like this to me i m really really upset but most of all embarrassed because we share all the same friend and i see a lot of those guy in that group chat and their friend regularly like who know who all ha seen this and i am mortified this is happening to me i asked him about the video again today and he said he ha no idea what i m talking about and he s sorry again but i have solid evidence and proof the video and he is still lying to me he doesn t know i have seen the video or that i have it in my possession i am going to confront him but i really don t even know how to i m so disgusted i do however love him and i guess what i m asking is is this an excusable thing i don t really trust him at all because of this but do you think this is something i will be able to work past and trust him again i feel bad just leaving him over this after we have been so good for 2 year am i wrong for feeling completely betrayed and would i be within my right to want to end the relationship over this how should i even confront him tl dr my boyfriend ha been sending around a video of me and iying to me about it i m so upset but i don t really know how to handle this,0
my 40 wife 39 want to give her parent a large chunk of money to help settle a tax issue a little background my wife and i have been together for nearly 20 year i just turned 40 she is 39 i grew up dirt poor she wa the exact opposite her dad is a doctor and she grew up not wanting for anything admittedly her parent have helped both of u out in our younger year and i am forever grateful for them without them i likely wouldn t have finished college and they have helped put u where we are today together we earn a pretty good income and with no kid are able to live the life we want i am an engineer and she is an attorney i would say we are comfortably in the middle class her dad ha had a history of impulsive purchase for a long a i ve known him car boat property he buy and sell constantly keep his finance very private and that ha always been a contentious subject in their family i ve known him to take all of our family and friend 20 people to europe only to sell several classic car a month later to pay off debt on the surface it appears he s very well off but i d assume he s always struggled with money and saving a we ve gotten older my wife and i have picked up a expense for them her mom and dad a they are in their early 70 s and working toward retirement football ticket trip unexpected bill and thing we ve gradually picked up their tab in growing amount over the last 5 year several year ago her brother who considers himself a real estate expert among other thing talked her dad into a real estate deal that turned out to be a monumental disaster he bought some property that turned out to be worthless and that multi million dollar deal ha haunted them for year a they ve been paying on this property to the tune of several thousand dollar a month for the last 7 8 year i don t see it ever selling and i have no doubt that ha put a serious dent into their finance anyway a year or so ago he received a judgement in the 300 400k range from a fellow doctor that screwed him over many year ago he never expected to receive a cent and when it arrived it wa a big surprise to them being in their 70 s we cautioned them to put it away and forget about it and we never heard about it again we assumed thing were good with them and overall his spending ha seemed to slow down a they are preparing for retirement the other day my wife get a call from her mother turn out he s behind in some tax payment and is having to pay tax on this judgement he received they d met with their tax person and they owe the irs something to the tune of 150k her mom told her that her dad confided in her that he d spent the entire judgement on other bill and he had almost nothing in saving which came a a shock to their family moment later her dad called and relayed the same information saying how embarrassed and sorry he wa and how he didn t know what he wa going to do at the same time my fiancee and i try and live within our budget and save where we can although we do enjoy our social life in addition to our saving we have almost 100k in liquid asset that we ve been putting away for our dream boat admittedly the money is probably 70 her my wife s earnings but being married we share everything 50 50 and it s been understood that this boat is what we re working for it s taken u several year to save this amount my wife immediately offer to give not loan just give her dad the 100k to help get him out of this jam he declined but she had him on speaker phone and i could hear him sort of perk up when she mentioned it they ve talked a couple more time in the last few day and while he still is declining it she still keep offering and he is starting to almost accept it aww i can t do that i mean i know you guy have been saving for that boat that wouldn t be right it s making me queasy and i keep asking her to rethink this decision and stop offering her argument is that her parent have always helped u out and they have but in much much smaller amount for instance helped with rent a few month when we were in college and he also payed off a 5k collection from an old credit card she unknowingly had they ve probably helped u out to the tune of 10k over the year we have repayed that several time over in the past 5 year my argument is that her dad is constantly up and down in money this isn t nearly the first financial crisis he s had like this it always seems to work out and i feel that if she bail him out he s just going to do it again i ve asked her to get a tally of where that judgement went and she say she can t ask him that he s admitted he s broke and that s it she doesn t want to dig she s kind of resigned herself to we ll just start over saving and in a couple of year we ll have enough to get the boat again and the boat isn t my idea this is something we ve both agreed and worked toward i love her parent but i just can t see turning over that kind of money especially with a bad a finance a he is realistically i could see him putting half of it toward his tax bill and squandering the other half if it wa left to him so i don t know what to do or how to talk her out of this one i haven t put my foot down yet and don t know that i can given the seriousness of the issue help tl dr my wife s father ha squandered away an unexpected windfall and my wife want to help him with his tax bill,0

should i tell my sil that her husband is from a family of pedophile alright this is quite a sticky situation and i could use an unbiased opinion tl dr at the bottom my 28f sil 30f is about to give birth to her first child a daughter we are all very excited and can t wait to meet her however something ha been looming over me since i found out she wa having a girl being that her husband come from a family of multiple pedophile and his family protects the pedophile instead of casting them out the reason i know this and sil doesn t is completely accidental my close coworker saw me scrolling through the book of face and noticed my sil s last name it s not a common name my coworker had me pull up sil s profile and her face went white my coworker then explained that her ex husband is cousin with sil s husband furthermore her ex is her ex because he wa convicted of child porn and sending lewd text to underaged girl he ha been in and out of prison for 7 year her ex s father and uncle were also convicted pedophile i saw the court document showing how the uncle had called a 12 year old girl and masturbated while on the phone with her it wa the 80 so he did not get in nearly enough trouble a he should have i am not certain what the father ha done my coworker went on to tell me she know all of the family member very well and sil s husband ha even played with coworker s daughter when she wa young of course my coworker ha no contact with them now after everything she discovered she also ha a restraining order against her ex i am in no way accusing my sil s husband of being a pedophile my issue is that he is very close with his family and ha even hung out with his cousin my coworkers ex between prison stay so it lead me to believe he accepts their behavior my sil know none of this when i first found out i told my so who told my mil and she made the family decision to not tell sil the whole family know except for sil and that wa that until she announced she wa having a baby girl with sil due to give birth any day now i am incredibly concerned about this situation she may leave her daughter with her husband family unattended and something may happen she isn t particularly fond of her in law but having kid kinda force you to see them more regularly i would hate myself if something happening to her daughter because she wasn t aware of the danger she wa putting her daughter in by being around these people but i also feel like it may be out of my hand a my mil is aware and clearly want to keep this info from sil her reasoning is that sil will fly off the handle and be upset with u i disagree and think that this child s safety is the most important thing and if it wa my daughter i would definitely want to know so i m considering talking to sil privately and telling her to never ever under and circumstance leave her child with the in law unattended me and sil aren t particularly close but we ve become closer since she got pregnant so i feel she would not fly off the handle with me if i told her we have know each other for 3 year however this would definitely create strife not only in her marriage but possibly between myself and mil so i m not sure what to do i ve considered talking to mil again but she will not always be around the baby to keep an eye out especially if sil is at the in law i could use some direction advice reddit tl dr my future sil s husband come from a family of pedophile sil doesn t know this sil is about to give birth to a baby girl should i tell her to be extremely cautious about letting her daughter spend time with husband family,0

my f36 sister in law f29 and one of her child m9 died in an accident now everyone is mad at me this will be super long but i am trying to give all the relevant detail i will preface this by saying i did not know my sister in law well she wa my husband s half sister in fact i m not close with any of my inlaws and neither is my husband for the most part my husband his sister and his brother all have the same mother but each have a different father however my fil helped raise husband s sibling until he and mil split for the last time when sil wa 13 my husband and inlaws are from the meth capital of the world his entire family ha substance abuse issue my fil 54 is a raging break thing start bar fight alcoholic which is why he is no longer with mil he also occasionally smoke crack mil 53 is addicted to prescription drug and weed my bil 19 dropped out of high school and ha since only done drug in mil s garage which is also his bedroom mil recently married the drug dealer she s been intermittently with since leaving fil so it wa not a surprise when sil left home at 14 addicted to meth she initially slept with dealer to feed her habit then wa essentially trafficked by the man that later became her husband her husband they may even be divorced it s being looked into will be in prison for a very long time he wa charged with meth manufacturing distributing blowing up a property and accidentally killing people and his parent because of his negligence i don t know when that occurred but from my understanding sil got clean not long after to keep the kid three of these child she had herself three are her husband s from previous relationship other woman like sil i m told the woman relinquished their parenting right also being looked into sil s child by birth 6m 9m deceased 12f husband s 11m 13m 16m the 6 9 and 13 year old all have varying issue from exposure to drug in vitro developmental and some physical it is believed sil somehow lost control of her vehicle resulting in the death of her and the 9 year old in the front seat it may have been drug related the remaining kid went into care until family member could be reached she did not have much of a relationship with her family since leaving home one of the last time we saw her wa year ago when we were visiting my fil she wa super high at a gas station and solicited my husband she didn t realize who he wa needle to say my husband wa devastated and we tried to get her help but she stole my purse and ran a few year after that she came to visit fil s house and we met her and the kid she wa a bit drunk but she didn t seem high the youngest wa about 12 month then and the rest of them were completely out of control with a penchant for stealing too we hadn t seen her since none of the inlaws had either to put it bluntly my husband would have had a similar fate if he had not met me my situation wa not good but it wasn t because of drug it wa because of militant religion and all kind of abuse we both grew up very very poor and i did not want that to be my fate i ran away at 15 got two job while going to high school and when he wanted to date i told him he needed to get his shit together because i wouldn t let him hold me back he stopped smoking pot stopped excessively drinking and surprised u all by joining the military we have been stationed overseas for most of the past 19 year he is retiring next year when he hit his 20 year mark my husband and i didn t want kid until we were both done with our respective education and in a financially sound place when that happened we didn t actively try for kid but we weren t taking step to prevent pregnancy either it never happened about 2 year ago my husband abruptly decided he no longer wanted child and did not want to discus it this wa at the same time my fil announced he had cancer and all our attention and extra finance went to help him because he did not have insurance i even took out a 65k loan at husband s request to help pay for some treatment fil needed we were no longer financially stable so i never brought kid up again a few week ago i wa looking for some picture on our shared computer when i discovered a hidden folder it wa filled with picture of a roughly two year old boy that looked remarkably like my husband after further investigating everything in the house including finding a hidden phone i learned my husband ha been leading a double life where i thought our 19 year marriage wa a strong one he ha been having an affair for three year all the time he had to leave because of the military half of them were fake the woman know about me they have said terrible terrible thing about me he is planning on divorcing me a soon a he retires and we go back to the state so he can bring his mistress and their son over he also plan to ask for alimony from me because i have made more money while we ve been married and pretty much carried u financially i paid for both of our education most of the bill and all grocery while the military provided structure and discipline he didn t always like it so he will be retiring at his recent rank of e 5 he doe not know that i know about his secret life i am still a bit shell shocked we were what everyone called the perfect couple there were never any red flag in that regard all of that is relevant because the inlaws and everyone else are pressuring u to adopt sil s child they think because we are more successful than they are we can afford to take care of everything and everyone they want me to move back now to get a place to take everyone in including mil bil and sfil on top of the child if adopted the military will cover the child s insurance and i believe we d get a larger housing allowance but that would only last until he got out he flat out said no to adopting because he didn t want some drug addled kid ruining my retirement we would also be missing my income if i left now which would be a significant blow especially in light of the money we ve borrowed for fil it would have been a hard decision before i found out about my husband but since i know about his deceit i really don t think we could adopt them and i have that man in my life for the rest of my life i ve been monitoring communication between him and his mistress and she is now encouraging him to adopt her reasoning is that they could get custody of the kid and get child support and alimony from me then they could pawn the child off on the inlaws he is now fully on board with her idea and ha started saying thing like oh he shouldn t be so harsh those poor kid need family etc etc essentially trying to soften me up to do this after he said no before frankly i m disgusted by everyone they all see these kid who have been through immeasurable tragedy a pawn instead of people they are going to need therapy for sure and i m also fairly sure they will need medical and dental intervention because they did not appear to be getting it the last time we saw them i have been told the youngest ha never even been to a doctor and none of them have ever been to a dentist i really want what is best for the child however a ashamed a i am to say i am not sure that i am the right person i m around kid at work but i realize it s different than actual parenting i don t think i could support 5 kid a a single parent and i m not sure i am emotionally equipped for an instant family that will need a lot of attention when my life is falling apart and i am already heartbroken i m also not sure that i could do well a a special need parent they need someone with experience to help them navigate all their feeling and life in general and especially since they are acting out they need someone who can be fully dedicated to them from the beginning the pressure from the inlaws a

i wa just hit with a realization about my relationship with an abusive girl thats been going on for 8 year i ve never been in a relationship that wasn t this no one else ha told me they loved me nor have i ever told someone else i loved them i ve been completely warped by this girl for a third of my life i can t leave because i can never be with someone else i would be a terrible partner for any sane person if i ever muster up the courage to break it off i will undoubtedly isolate myself and the fear of being alone is enough to keep me coming back and trying to make this work i just need to fucking die,1
i 35 f am unsure if husband 34 m ha had emotional affair or if he just prefers confiding other woman husband and i have been married two year and he ha had what i consider to be two emotional affair the first time it wa with a female friend who he briefly hooked up with before meeting me the friend wa interested in a relationship but he wa not he lied to me about hanging out with her once and texted with her frequently reminiscing about the fun time they had and sometimes inviting her to run or cycle with him when i lost it over him lying about spending time with her and told him to cut thing off he said he would however he did not and instead told her about our fight and continued to confide in her about his frustration with me for many month it took me blowing up at him many time and finally threatening to leave for that to end we had been dating for a year when it started and two year when it ended this time around the potential emotional affair partner is the woman i considered my best friend who wa our mutual friend husband and i met through her she wa my maid of honor we did everything together often with my husband the three of u hung out together a lot and she wa my listening ear when i wa having trouble with my husband and anything else my husband and i had a big fight 6 month ago where i got blackout drunk and called him a liar a cheater etc i can t remember most of it but my word were detrimental to the relationship this fight occurred in front of my best friend so she heard some of it thought it wa not about her it wasn t about anything in particular i just lost it over year of anxiety i guess after this fight my husband and best friend more or le shut me out and began talking and spending time with each other without me they both got more and more distant with me and while i suspected they were both avoiding me i wasn t sure why my husband acted like i wa a burden and my best friend wa distant cold and sometimes didn t interact at all i recently accidentally discovered an old device in our home is still linked to my husband s online chat by this point i wa seeing 2 therapist weekly and popping anxiety medication all day due to my unease about my husband and i so i looked at the chat nothing wa flirtatious but he wa confiding in her for month usually daily about how frustrated he wa with me i had asked him for year not to tell friend about our private conversation and problem and he agreed but he told her everything and then told her not to tell me he wa inviting her along to thing i thought were rare date between himself and i he wa making plan with her without me and they were both mystified a to why i thought that wa a problem when he would tell me he wa going out with her they met up while i wa out of town and agreed not to tell me about it once my husband hurt himself while he wa out of town and drunk and messaged her all about it while ignoring my phone call and text i didn t know what wa going on and wa worried about not hearing from him when i could see he wa online so i messaged my best friend freaking out she wa chatting with my husband at the same time but she pretended to be a confused a i wa and spent the next 3 hour consoling me and suggesting that maybe he wa fast asleep instead of online and ignoring me the two of them chatting daily and spending time together without me never happened until after this fight 6 month ago in these chat it is mostly him sending hey what s up message generally late at night or when he s out of town especially after we have been fighting it also appears he deleted two month worth of chat in between the existing chat a well a their text thread which i find odd i confronted him about all of this and he is scrambling to make good with me he is saying all the right thing and is very worried i will leave like i m threatening to and say he cannot believe what he ha done blah blah blah honestly i want to leave him over this because i feel so uneasy and cannot trust him anymore he betrayed my confidence so many time and turned to my best friend of all people i don t believe he had physical affair but this still shatters me tl dr my husband confides in other woman instead of me he doesn t flirt but share intimate non sexuaal thought and tell them about private conversation between himself and especially when it involves them are these emotional affair,0

update new guy 30 in the unit always using my 30sm ps4 and the living room television original gt tl dr of last post asked the new roommate to budget his ps4 time and he said no he plan to play it whenever all the time the big news is now he s deleting my game to make room for his game without asking permission background so it s been a month or so since my last post and there s been some development overall he had responded to previous request didn t game all the time and generally stopped playing when asked still annoying but whatever however new guy added a bunch of game and i got a warning message that the hard drive wa about full i removed all but currently playing title and said not to download anything else because there s limited space and i needed to finish some game to make room for next game subsequent to this he signed up for gamer pas subscription on both console of mine the ps4 and the xb1 i looked at the ps4 storage and it would appear these game are not locally installed i wa perturbed that he would a add game without permission b cleverly sidestepped the rule but not actually installing anything whatever i let it go however with the launch of outer world on xb1 he actually did install that and last night he admitted he had to delete one of my game to make room for it for context he deleted a game with the least recent logged playtime all i really said at first wa i would have preferred you had asked permission his excuse wa this happened at 2 in the morning when i wa asleep and he didn t want to wake me up to ask so all thing being equal i guess i should be happy he didn t wake me up at 2 in the morning to ask if he could delete a game but i would have said no i am very upset by his action i didn t lose a temper or start a fight but i sat with it for a little while before determining this wa a step too far i informed him he wa not allowed to use console anymore in our brief conversation he didn t seem to understand this is not a punishment insomuch a a trust issue if i can t trust him to use the device responsibility he cannot use the device period it s not like he deleted save file afaik but the not asking permission ha me livid he feel like he s being grounded which is not how i see it at all we re all adult here and when i said don t install anything his willful misinterpretation seemed to apply that rule to only the ps4 he also doesn t seem to remember me saying that he said his thinking wa more fluid i don t know what that mean than mine and that i wa being too sensitive okay doesn t change my mind he did apologize but it wa one of those i m sorry you feel that way style apology later after i wa in bed but not asleep he came into my room and said can we make this right and not draw it out and i just said not tonight dude i m in bed he doe seem to be under the impression that there s a time limit on banning him from console i don t see it that way i don t like the idea of allowing a person access to my data placing that data at risk due to his poor and inconsiderate decision making skill so i put it up for discussion trust ha been violated how would you recommend going forward we still have to live together my gut say if he want to console game he need to invest in his own console word alone won t change my mind now and no single action he did offer to delete outer world and reinstall my game if it meant he could keep using console but the joke s on him because i can do all that myself will unban him from gaming console final thought i m saving money for my own place hopefully sometime next year tl dr roomie deleted my game to make room for his game without permission roomie no longer ha access to gaming console looking for recommendation on next step,0

i 23m am struggling to be a good listener when my fiance 21m of nearly a year won t stop talking about work i d like to preface this by stressing the importance of my fiancé to me we re extremely compatible we re just also young and working on our communication skill he s trying to learn work life balance i m trying to learn to not bottle up thing i am aware that i have been a detached jerk to him at time over this issue which is why i m here i d like to stop being a jerk and i want the perspective of people who have maybe dealt with something similar i want to tell him but i don t want to hurt his feeling doing so my fiancé is a fairly new night shift nurse he deal with a lot of patient work related drama and medical situation he will come home and after briefly greeting me and asking me how i am launch into what feel like a blow by blow rundown of his 12 hour shift and each of his patient without identifying detail on a weekday i have about 20 minute between when he get home and when i would like to be out the door for work so i am already only giving him half of my attention at most while i get ready i usually have to cut him off mid monologue and go to work he pick right back up when i get home and he s getting ready for work and it only stop when he s out the door when he ha day off we like to go on walk and spend time together however at any given moment he ll launch off about work again for upwards of the next hour he can spend an entire three mile walk talking nonstop about work more patient story story i ve already heard a lot of medical terminology i don t understand and a lot of frankly gross detail i will try to redirect him onto different subject but it often steer right back into work i find myself tuning out and giving him the uh huh response over and over again i feel awful but it s so draining sometimes to work five day a week and then in a huge portion of my downtime with my partner live out his emotionally draining job i do think this is an issue that s at least partially a result of the following factor when he get shafted on his work schedule he may only have one or two day off at a time he s also a night shift nurse so sometimes that day off between two shift is pretty much entirely spent asleep this obviously make it so his entire life for five day at a time might just be sleep eat work this make it difficult for him to talk about much besides work he ha a lot more interaction drama and sudden twist that his job throw at him i am a graphic designer i stare at a screen with headphone on for most of the day a a result of the above point i don t really talk about my job at all it would be very tedious for me to rave about the conference branding i m working on you try explaining something visual when you don t have access to the file at home or rant about two hour marketing meeting so maybe my lack of motivation to talk about my job heightens the imbalance of receiving all the blow by blow detail of his job i don t want to make him feel like he can t talk to me about his job he need to vent and he doesn t get to talk to his other friend from nursing school a much due to their opposite schedule so i am his go to because we live together however i find myself getting too frustrated with the secondhand emotional fatigue of his job on top of my own work exhaustion i love my job i m just tired when i come home i get to the point sometimes where i leave for work early just so we miss each other in passing and i can avoid the morning conversation i don t know how to tell him that i want him to talk le about his job without hurting his feeling and making him feel like a burden tl dr my fiance talk about his job before i leave for work after i get home from work in bed over text and in a lot of our downtime together i don t know how to tell him that i want him to talk le about his job without causing him a lot of insecurity and emotional grief,0
my 27f best friend s 28m new wife 33f want me to cut contact what do i do i ve been best friend with james for about 9 year we ve been through a lot together within a year of befriending him i lost both my parent and he helped me deal with it having lost his mum the year before when he wanted to quit drinking i having been in aa for 2 year offered to be his sponsor and i helped him through that at one point i wa in a relationship that turned abusive and james wa the one that helped get me out of it we bonded very quickly because of these thing and in present day i can t imagine life without him nothing romantic ever happened with u i think of him a a brother and he think of me a a sister i m godmother to his 2 year old son james ha been for the most part sober since he started aa but ha had a few slip the most recent being last new year which i helped him through and he s wanted to relapse a lot more than that the most recent being at his bachelor party when his well meaning soon to be brother in law forgot about his sobriety and tried to make him drink and i wa the one to stop him james ha been with his wife jen for about 3 5 year last year james said to me that he d had to have a talk with jen about our relationship because we d gone out to dinner alone james said that after their talk she wa feeling a lot better about our friendship but after that i still got weird vibe from her when we hung out around her she would hover nearby and inject herself into our conversation this wouldn t be a problem but if we were referencing an inside joke she would get irritated if we wanted to go somewhere she would give u a reason we couldn t i might be going to the shop later so you need to look after the baby and then she wouldn t go to the shop and the last time i went to his place and she wa there we d agreed to talk for at least a few hour but she asked me to leave within about half an hour she s never been openly rude or anything just maybe a bit hostile amp x200b they got married yesterday saturday 9th i messed up at the wedding james had me a one of his groomsman i wore a pantsuit my white shirt got soaked and wa see through and clingy despite me putting it in the dryer and there weren t available shirt that would fit me so i just wore the jacket to the wedding and reception not thinking it would be a big deal a the main thing exposed wa the triangle of skin by my neck and collarbone which is where a shirt would normally sit under a suit jacket there wasn t much cleavage unless you were taller than me which at 5 9 in 4 inch heel isn t common and standing right in front of me while looking down i can honestly say i wa probably among the more covered up woman at the wedding a most woman had short dress and low neckline but i realise that a one of the wedding party i wa being held to a different standard and foregoing the shirt wa a really bad call james said nice suit when he saw me no comment on the lack of a shirt so i assumed it wa fine i got a few compliment but at one point the maid of honour came up to me and said that jen had said i wa dressed inappropriately and should have figured something out when my shirt wa unusable amp x200b i realise that i did mess up on that count so about half an hour ago i sent jen a message pretty much just congratulating them on the wedding a i d not spoken to her at the reception and apologising for my faux pa i wa not expecting her to call me or even respond any time soon a it is the morning after the wedding but within about 5 minute of me sending the message she rang we had a short conversation where she did most of the talking and in that conversation she said that i should stop speaking to james my wedding attire seems to be the straw that broke the camel back because she said again how inappropriate it wa to dress like that around james specifically and that she didn t like our relationship she said if i wanted to make it up to her then the best thing i could do would be to tell james to leave me alone and stay away from her family amp x200b she s hung up and i m sat here wondering how thing got this messed up james is my best friend and i can t imagine life without him but he ha a wife now and she is the mother of his child and she ha set a boundary i don t agree with this boundary in any sense but it s what she want i could ignore it pretend it never happened and carry on a normal but that will only make thing worse for james marriage i could do what she say but then i lose my best friend and james loses his sponsor it wa a voice call and i didn t record it so i have no proof it even happened and i can t mess thing up for james so early in his marriage especially when he ha a young son to think about and literally got married yesterday i have no clue what to do here should i do what jen say and stop speaking to james or should i ignore jen to maintain my relationship with my best friend amp x200b tl dr best friend got married yesterday today his new wife is telling me to end our friendship should i do what she say and stop speaking to my best friend or try and maintain the friendship,0

my 21f boyfriend m30 got mad that i spilt something and started yelling at me and it reminds me so much of my abusive father is this a sign of future abusive behavior from him my bf and i have been together for a 1 year and 6 month and the one thing i love about him is he s nothing like my father to give you some background my dad wa an incredibly manipulative and emotionally verbally abusive man from a young a i can remember he would get so pissed when me my sibling would drop something and yell at u and insult u sometimes even hit u today i decided to wash the dish before i went to bed i usually leave them for the next morning because i am at home i opened the oven to find a dirty tray and 2 pan i didn t realise that one of those pan wa filled with oil and ended up spilling it all over myself and the floor i wa a little bit shocked and my initial reaction wa to call for my bf instead of being understanding or trying to help he started yelling at me and asking me who asked you to clean everything at night and who told you to spill oil all over the floor a if i d done it on purpose i never ever expected him to react like that i know this may seem like something little but in that moment he reminded me so much of my dad the way he wa speaking to me the way he made me feel it brought me back to those exact moment when i wa a kid and had spilt a glass of water or dropped a plate and my dad wa screaming at me for being an idiot i don t understand we ve been living together for almost a year and i m certain i ve dropped plenty of thing in the past i am quite clumsy and i don t ever remember him reacting like this i don t know if i ve been making excuse for him all along or if something ha changed but to bring me to the purpose of this post am i overreacting for getting so upset and is this a possible sign of future abusive behaviour i feel like i can t even look at my bf and every time i think about how he yelled at me i burst into tear it s just so scary how much it reminds me of my dad maybe it wouldn t be so bad if in the aftermath of the incident he came to me and wa like hey i shouldn t of blown up at you like that i m sorry but now he s acting exactly the way my dad would have even more unapologetic and acting almost a if i deserved to be shouted at because i did something stupid maybe i m just overly sensitive because i m in my feeling a this only happened about 2 hour ago but when i think about my mum and how she ended up with my dad for over 20 year and i hear the story of how they were in the beginning i realise my dad never started out abusive it wa something that happened gradually over time there is a part of me that is scared this is an early sign in my bf but i m also unsure because i ve been living with him for a year and haven t noticed anything before maybe i just have daddy issue and am looking into this too much tl dr my boyfriend blew up at me for spilling oil in the kitchen and it reminded me of my abusive dad been living with him for a year but this is the first time he s reacted like this is this a sign of future emotionally abusive behaviour,0

he s just fucking playing game with me he wa on the phone with me last night and i guess one of his friend wa with him after like 10 minute of berating me i heard someone quietly ask in the background who in the world are you talking to and my boyfriend said oh my girlfriend don t worry she love the abuse he said it a a joke to his friend but both him and i know that the abuse is real and true although i will and would never love it then just now he tagged me in a facebook post it stated something along the line of when you find a girl who will stick with you no matter how badly your treat her or how bad of a person you are then keep her keep her forever because you ll never find another and he added yep and you ll be mine forever no matter what you ain t getting away,1
am i 25 f unreasonable in asking for one night without multi player video game after a really rough couple of day questioning my sanity i 26 f would sincerely appreciate an outside opinion on this argument that my husband 30 m and i are having brief background we met when i wa 17 and he wa 22 and started dating when i turned 18 he s been my first everything kiss sex etc we had high high and low low but i feel that thing averaged out to a pretty beautiful relationship we knew i wa likely going to be moving for grad school so we ended up getting married when i wa 21 because we felt at the time that it would be easier to have our first year of marriage when i wa still in undergrad rather than an intensive graduate program i did end up getting into a phd program and we moved to a larger city and thing have been pretty great he ha a great job here we ve made some friend have a little animal horde that we love to piece the whole 9 yard now to the juicy part the majority of phd program have a check around year 3 4 in which you essentially give a write up on what you think your thesis will be on and present in front of your committee thing go well and you become a phd candidate thing don t go well and a myriad of thing can happen ranging from strong suggestion to change your topic all the way to having to leave the program with that in mind i ve been working relentlessly for the last month preparing for this my husband s main hobby is video game and he s started to play with a fairly big group of people on discord and can get quite rowdy we live in an area that ha a very high cost of living so our house is pretty small and it s impossible to get away from the noise however i just put on my headphone and try to drown him out because he should be able to relax in his own home the night before my exam i asked him if he would mind just playing solo game for that night so that i could practice my talk and not be cloistered into our bedroom the quietest place in the house he said no worry and then two hour later wa on the game i waited 30 min for the match to be over and politely reminded him of our agreement he told me he wasn t being super loud and i shouldn t be anxious about practicing because his friend didn t care if they could hear me i attempted to explain that it wa distracting i wa a nervous wreck etc but it just fell on deaf ear embarrassingly i kind of lost it after my 3rd attempt at asking him to stop and started bawling and begging him to please just give me one night he refused and i ended up in the bedroom practicing and cry the plot twist is that he ha just been digging in that he wa completely justified in playing and that i m being incredibly selfish asking him to not play that evening going into how i knew i wa going to pas and therefore being dramatic i m making it about myself etc i did end up passing huzzah and drove back home to my parent to celebrate because he didn t even say congratulation and didn t even call that evening this is a massive deal in my education and my uncle actually didn t pas this exam and had to go to a different institution i m completely devastated that he couldn t put this fight aside and at least acknowledge this accomplishment my point in making this post wa to throw this question out into the interwebs wa it unreasonable for me to ask him to not be on discord for the evening before the major exam tl dr wife asks for some god damn peace and quiet night before massive exam in grad school husband decline and loudly play overwatch and still think his wife is selfish for asking,0

is my boyfriend abusive i 24f never thought my partner 32m wa abusive i m honestly very happy in my relationship we are together for almost 5 year and i grow up so much this year and i always felt my boyfriend is a good influence in my life the thing is my best friend 25f hate him and say he is abusive i posted in another sub about it it wa mostly looking for advice on how dealing with my friend and people were actually concerned that indeed my relationship wa problematic and risky it crashed me because i wa concerned if my friend wa just being resentful and i feel afraid right now that i m ignoring important thing because i m blind by love because i m naive and unexperienced i don t know if it s just the way i m wording thing and make my boyfriend look bad or if it s that our relationship have some natural red flag age difference it is my first relationship we are from different country we were both aware of that and there wa effort to mitigate the impact of those thing we have very open communication about our relationship but i don t even know how to bring such harsh accusation over him and i m not even sure how it would help most worrisome thing my friend had brought up is the fact that she think my boyfriend control my money and diet i don t see it this way but he indeed ha a large influence over it and i always thought it wa for good my family wa always very permissive so i had very unhealthy habit both on eating and spending money when we met i wa studying abroad with a scholarship my scholarship wa fairly decent and allowed me have a comfortable life however i wa spending a lot of money without much thought because my parent would always cover for me i wa 19 20 at that time it wa enough time to have a bit more of financial maturity but i didn t even had thought about it i wasn t really used to think that i should save money for something i wanted this made me very dependent on my parent because even when i got a better job i still wouldn t be able to deal with my bill because it seemed to always escalate it also made feed a bit of unhealthy relationship with my parent because wa they were giving me money they always felt in right to control a lot of my life since i grow more independent it seems we managed to get a healthier distance we still quite close but before my mom would call me several time a day it wa really overwhelming what my boyfriend did when we decided to move in together wa to talk with me how i should be realistic about my income he didn t want my parent sending money every month to cover thing and didn t want to live a life he couldn t pay for just because my parent would cover it for u he wanted me to save money and contribute to the house and to have a healthier relationship with money when i wa making a lot le than him we would split the bill proportionally with the condition i would save part of the money honestly i don t think this wa a big deal he never told me what to do with the money i saved except for giving me advice on where to put it i had to adapt to a more frugal and le consumerist lifestyle and i feel i m a better person this way today he mostly take care of the bill because i often forget to pay thing on time early day on the month is often my most stressful day so i just send him the money and whenever we both want to buy something more expensive we tend to discus it among u my friend thought it wa bad that i wanted a new tv and my boyfriend is making me to wait if we can get a better deal at black friday we already have a tv but isn t connected to the internet also she wa with u when we talked about it and she say it wa bad that my boyfriend mentioned that i should think first about fixing my laptop battery which i needed to do and it wa a bit expensive i think since we live together this sort of thing is normal i mean i don t need his money to buy the tv but i don t think it s bad i ask his input with the diet thing i ve been a bit overweight all my life and i really have an emotional thing with food plus i tend to have binge eating episode it s not a daily life thing but sometimes it get out of control like eating all the food available or ordering like 3 different kind of take out to eat in a sitting or having a meal and think i need something sweet to finish it but then getting a snack and something sweet after it and then a snack my boyfriend had dealt with me getting sick because of that several time my friend and my parent had seem me throwing up and feeling ill because of that and never did much to help except telling me i should lose weight so my boyfriend brought up the concept of this being an eating disorder and that i should see a therapist which i m doing and it s being helpful i m also seeing a nutritionist he often push me to healthier option and call me out if he notice i m getting in those binging episode it s not like he say i can t eat fast food but he will often call me out if i m going for my second mcdonald s meal in a week he won t say i shouldn t but i think he just want me to be aware of what i m eating he never put condition on that or made me feel guilt if i fail on something and end up having a binging episode he offer me support i also did changed a bit my appearance during this relationship not all wa related to my boyfriend this wa an important moment of my life i lived for year in a foreigner country we moved to my home country this year etc but there is stuff i kind of felt free to do because he would endorse like stop using make up or earring which wasn t stuff i liked but felt the need to use sometimes so i wa a proper woman i also let my hair longer now because he used to tell me he liked it that way i like when he play with it and i want to be a pretty a possible for him i think it s also important to note that my boyfriend always wanted me to have my own circle of friend when i decided to stay on his country he wa really afraid that i would be too dependent on him a most of people i knew there were also exchange student that would move out soon he really pushed me to get hobby and meet new friend this wa a significant change for me because i wa pretty much a lonely person who stayed a lot at home i like now that i have friend and hobby we share some in common but there is also stuff i do alone to be honest i really think my relationship is great and i feel worried why a lot of people doesn t seem to agree i know for the age difference and my lack of experience i m in a vulnerable position but i don t think this is enough to make me suspicious of someone who ha been very good to me am i being too naive should i take precaution something that also put me off believing in the concern of my friend against my boyfriend is that she often make petty regard again him reproducing bad stereotype of his country continent that he is slow doesn t shower everyday cold and emotionless or just say he is ugly and look too old and is getting bald tl dr i think my relationship is great but my best friend think he is controlling and abusive i can t see why but i wonder if i m just naive and or am deluding myself,1

my 24 younger sister 17 is planning to have a baby with her boyfriend 19 a soon a she turn 18 she will not listen to me or our parent and her boyfriend s family is supporting her decision so first off we re from a small town in the southern u where a lot of girl get married and have baby right out of high school so my sister ha a lot of example of people she can point to and say that they did the same thing she s planning to do and it turned out fine i ve tried showing her episode of teen mom and sixteen and pregnant and she just say that she s not going to have that difficulty because she s not going to be in school while trying to have and raise a baby i don t know how else to get through to her she just seems blind to the fact that this isn t going to be a walk in the park her boyfriend and her have been dating since middle school and so she s fully convinced that he s committed to her and i guess it doe seem like he is because he s willing to go along with this he s what everyone in our town call a nice boy but i just doubt that he s responsible enough to be a father he doe already have a job in his family s business but i don t think it s enough to take care of my sister financially but his parent are old fashioned religious and think that him marrying a nice girl and having a baby immediately is a great decision so they re willing to help out his mom ha actually tried to ask my mom for her opinion about baby name they re totally supportive of this i really just need some advice about how to talk my sister out of this i m not that much older than she is and i cannot imagine already having a kid old enough to be in first grade it seems insane to me my parent agree and want my sister to go to college and get an education and not just pop out a baby with the first guy she s ever dated but she just seriously doesn t care what any of u think we can t really even stop her from seeing her boyfriend because she s obviously just going to run back to him a soon a she s 18 in february and probably never talk to our family again my father legitimately considered trying to get him in legal trouble over the age difference to keep them apart but it wasn t possible and he decided it would just push my sister closer to her boyfriend s family too please give me some advice on what to say to her i don t want to watch my sister make a life ruining decision and she s just impossible to get through to tl dr my sister is trying to get pregnant immediately at age 18 and i need to convince her not to ruin her life like that,0

forgave my 24f boyfriend 30 for cheating and worked on our relationship le than a year later he brought up having an open relationship together for 4 year where we have supported each other through so much in that time i can honestly say i would not be here without him i have been very open sexually and didn t think he felt like he wa missing out i am bi so we have had a few threesome and we loved that part of our relationship i m just not the type of person to be jealous when it come to having sex with other people it just need to be very open and honest and i ve said many time that i m only comfortable with being together with another person and maybe in the future i would be open to having our own individual experience when i m ready i trusted him a lot we moved in together september 2018 2 month later i saw text message when he wa next to me and i just felt there wa something there went through his message and saw that he had been seeing another woman i had no idea about or even knew existed they saw each other on and off for 6 month i think i wa heartbroken because we have always said how much we trust each other and our relationship and we are open and honest with each other about thing like this i wa absolutely devastated and disappointed he saw how much it hurt me and said he genuinely did not think i would hurt me this much since i don t get jealous when thing are strictly sex long story short i decided i want to save our relationship and we have had a lot of progress with some setback of course it ha not been an easy process a few day ago he brought up how we have talked about having an open relationship and wanted my thought on it he said that a strictly monogamous relationship isn t the only option and there s lot of different relationship out there i said that it s an absolute hard no to being completely open where we are both completely free to sleep with other people and he kept the conversation going by asking me why i felt that way and that it s just society telling me that it s not okay people are monogamous because they re insecure etc etc he even brought up polyamorous i kept saying no i started to feel like this wa a big thing for him so i said you need to know wether or not you can give that up or want to find someone else who is open to that kind of dynamic he say he loved me very much and of course without question he would want to be with me anyway later that evening he seemed very down and not like himself i kept asking him until he said he is processing thing he didn t know how he felt after our conversation i felt soooo angry that he needed to think about it and felt down after i had rejected it to me if he need to think about it i don t want to be with him and risk having more issue in the future this morning i felt absolutely enraged it dawned on me how absolutely inappropriate it wa to bring that up after the horrible year we went through to save our relationship and how could he keep arguing with me about it i wa loading the dishwasher and these thought kept circling and i wa getting more angry to the point of breaking one of our wine glass he came out to see what happened and i yelled at him about how ridiculous he is and insensitive if he needed to think about it then he really should just not be in a relationship i said some thing i regret and stormed out to go for a walk he text me saying that s not what he wa doing when we were having that conversation he just wanted to see how i felt about it and wasn t trying to argue or persuade me we are still fighting about it i m so upset and honestly dumbfounded that he d have the ball to say he need to think about wether he can be monogamous or not i have so many thought just circling and i m feeling so many emotion but i just really really want to be with him i don t want to be with anyone else and i can t imagine my life without him how do i approach this in a more calm manner why would he bring this up after what happened to u he broke my trust but maybe i needed to know sooner rather than later if he mean what he say and want to be with me should i just let it go anyways if he needed to think about it maybe it s just very important for him to have his freedom i m scared if we stay together he will regret it and wish he wa with someone with an open relationship tdlr boyfriend cheated worked through it now want an open relationship what doe this mean and how do i approach this,0

my 34f son s 8m father 34m keep giving him expensive electronics we can t afford to do the same for our daughter not sure how to handle situation advice i 34f had a son with bob 34m my son s name is junior 8m we were only together a few year bob is an extremely materialistic person he see thing like rent and light a commodity while the car payment and the latest phone are necessity it s one of the reason we broke it off i mention this because he doe not pay any child support only half of whatever itemized bill i present for medical or school expense honestly i m ok with this getting money out of bob when it s not for him is like pulling teeth and i am financially comfortable enough not to need it i married steve 35m a year ago steve ha two girl of his own 7 8 their mother is barely scraping by consequence of her own decision so she doesn t pay any child support at all i say all this to make the point that despite not having any or much financial support we re comfortable we still budget we put away in saving we don t keep flashy new thing in the house all the time bob however doe he make 50k a year life with his parent who don t ask him to pay any bill he s only responsible for himself he buy a new car every other year and eats the depreciation value on resale just to get another new one every new model phone on release day gadget laptop computer you name it honestly i m more than a little jealous which is why i m asking here for a sanity check and advice whenever he get something new he keep the last one he bought for backup and give the other one before it to our son for example bob bought an iphone x then an 11 then an 11 pro max he gave junior the x this past weekend that brings u to 1 laptop 5 tablet 4 phone all just at our home he ha a few gaming system desktop computer and other electronics at his grandparent dad house just junior s his dad ha more of his own i ve tried to walk a fine line between letting junior know that his father s lifestyle choice and lavish gift are unusual without being derogatory or dismissive of those choice this is because i make significantly more than his father and junior doesn t quite grasp why his father buy these thing but we do not we re open about our financials to a point with the kid kid don t understand health insurance and mortgage payment and saving for retirement or vacation emergency etc we teach them financial responsibility at a smaller level so they build good habit but they re just not ready to understand it like adult understand it _so my first question is is there a better way to explain to him these kind of different financial choice in a way he ll understand without speaking negatively about his father s choice _ next question is about the girl like i said their mother can barely afford herself let alone new shiny gadget they have their own electronics but they re older they re what we can afford and what we think is appropriate for kid their age to be responsible for certainly not the latest and greatest now i ve raised my son to be humble to appreciate what you are gifted and what you earn he absolutely doe not brag about what he ha or compare what he ha with what other kid have but he s reasonably excited about his electronics and fancy toy who wouldn t be he s not excessive but every time he come home with something new the girl are plainly jealous happy for their brother but still confused a to why they don t get these new fancy thing too on the one hand this imbalance is building character for all of them the girl are learning to temper their jealousy when someone they love ha a fancy thing they don t junior is learning to be aware of the line between sharing his excitement and bragging to understand that he ha been given a privilege others may not get a well on the other hand i can see a divide slowly forming in my family and it s breaking my heart i want the girl to have all of these nice thing too i don t want junior to feel like an outsider or that he ha to hide his nice thing or his excitement in using them i love all three of my child and i want the very very best for each of them even if i m not the one to provide it _how can i strike a balance between the child s luxury how do i make it clear to all the child that they ve done nothing wrong we re not choosing not to buy any of the kid these thing because of something they ve done but that junior s father is choosing to gift these thing because he s got hole for pocket but nicer _ tl dr my son s father spends a lot on luxury item which he gift to my son often a he upgrade my husband and i can t afford to do the same for his daughter how do we handle the imbalance in luxury item between our child while not disrespecting my son s father or punishing my son for having enjoying them,0

am i being abused okay so this is my first time ever on reddit sorry if i do something wrong i just really need advice i m currently 8 month pregnant with my boyfriend child we live with my parent and right now he s the only source of income i have i love him to death but i think he might be abusive in some kind of abusive so here s the story i started dating him two year ago i lived by myself in a small apartment i invited him over to a little party i had we knew each other before this and he stayed the night he pretty much never left talked about moving in and helping me pay rent which wa fine with me because living alone is expensive well two week after we started dating he quit his job and sold his car so now i m the only one working and the only one with a vehicle he would beg me every day to use my car while i wa at work and i would always say yes he d go around and smoke pot with his friend all day while i worked he did this for 8 month i finally made him get a job and he made me move out of my perfect little apartment into a 100 trailer in a trailer court where i wa woke up by gun shot at least three time a week the place wa disgusting he had quit his new job right before we moved in and again i wa the only one working 1 year ago today actually we found out i wa pregnant then on november 14th the day before my 21st birthday i had a miscarriage it wa the most painful and excruciating thing i had ever gone through he told me it wasn t my fault he made me feel loved in the next 24 hour but of course the next day i wanted to drink away all my problem we went to the bar with a couple friend and had a pretty good night over all until we got home and something set me off and i started hitting him he picked me up and slammed me on the floor and left the next day he came back and kept apologizing saying it wa the alcohol losing the baby and on top of it all his stepdad who raised him died two week prior i believed him and thought he wa just in a bad place i made him get a job before i took him back and thankfully in a couple day he had a new job but unfortunately it wa too late with all the time i had to take off work from being in the hospital i lost the trailer too it forced u to move apart i had to move in with my parent and he had to move in with his grandma eventually my parent let him move in with u and thing went great for a while in march my friend had a big get together bonfire and everyone wa drinking and having fun something set him off and he ended up screaming at me and cornering me of course all my friend came to help me and kicked him out he left in his truck he had just got and i stayed for a little while longer then on my way home i hit a deer and a tree i hadn t been drinking that night because i wa driving and he still accuses me to this day that i drank after he left i found out again i wa pregnant in april and now i m pregnant with our baby boy but when we found out he started drinking bad like every single night he wa at his best friend house drinking and smoking while i wa at work and he would pick me up drunk but the thing is after that party in march he told me i wasn t allowed to hang out with that set of friend anymore which wa my only friend so to save the arguing i agreed and only see them occasionally in special circumstance even then he get pissed off and call me the whole time blow up my phone and even sometimes show up to take me home when i haven t even asked him to so at this point i can t find u a home because of the eviction from the trailer we don t have a car and i don t have a job because no body will hire me at 8 month pregnant now here s where the story is starting to become a problem for me he s got a best friend who s been his best friend for 11 year i respect that that s a long time to be someone s friend except he s gay and in love with my boyfriend my boyfriend isn t gay whatsoever and he know that but he still get jealous when b my boyfriend chooses to hang out with me instead of him they gotten into multiple fight about how b doesn t spend enough time with him which i don t understand he wake up every morning at 7am and go to his house to smoke before work go to work at 8 30 get off work and go straight back over to his house at 5 until 8 9 pm and then come home and go straight to bed every single day where s the time for me you ask there is none i m not allowed at his friend house because it make him uneasy how we act around each other like a normal freakin couple well last night i begged b to stay home and spend some time with me instead of going over there and of course he chose him over me now i hate to admit this and i ve never admitted it before but i ve been having suicidal thought lately my depression is getting so out of hand because i have absolutely no friend no one to talk to all day no car to drive around in no money to go out and pamper myself and every time i try to talk to him he ignores it tonight is my last straw i admitted to him i m completely jealous of his relationship with this friend i m forced to sit at home 24 7 while he go and doe whatever he want whenever he want and he laughed at me and then left to go to his friend house he promised me he would only be gone long enough to smoke it s been 6 hour now he won t answer my text and i think i ve made a decision it s me or his friend i hate to do it to him it s not nice at all i hate to be that girlfriend but i m scared of hurting myself after i have the baby i want to be here to watch him grow up and do everything a mother should but i can t do it confined to a house like this doe anybody have any advice for me i m sorry this is so long i just am so lost right now in my life and i don t know what to do,1

my f23 mother f50s doesn t like that i asked my boyfriend m24 to get tested for stis and want me to leave him i need help in handling this situation just some context i ve never been in a relationship before nor have i had any sexual intercourse with anybody i have not had any intercourse with my boyfriend yet i ve been seeing this man for 2 month now and am now in a relationship with him i waited two month before disclosing my relationship with him to my parent because i didn t want any interference or question being asked i wanted some privacy before letting people know i wa seeing him so my mother ha asked me a few day ago that she want me to use protection and to stay safe during sex which i told her that we are that s a lie because i haven t had sex with him yet and i mentioned to her that i wa being safe and asked him to get tested for sti s which he agreed to after having that conversation two day later she came to my room to talk to me about my relationship she said that she couldn t sleep all night because i told her that i asked my boyfriend to get checked for stis she said that no men will have a relationship with a woman that asks her that and that he will leave me for another woman that doesn t ask him to get tested she also went on and said that he ll lie about it and go sleep with another woman she mentioned that i have issue with building relationship i ve never dated any man before him so i m not quite sure what she is trying to say and that i m afraid of living and bacteria i think she is trying to mention about the sti topic and that she is worried for me to be clear i ve never had a relationship before due to the fact that i wasn t feeling ready and needed to work on myself but i have friend and am very happy with them also i felt really uncomfortable when she told me those thing and i feel like she is trying to install fear worry tl dr my mother is not happy that i asked my boyfriend to get tested for stis and belief that he will cheat on me and leave me for another woman and therefore i need to end my relationship with him how should i approach this with my mother should i mention this to my boyfriend,0
my wife 26 f absolutely refuse to let me 32 m help with housework she got mad when i insisted that i want to help i don t get it i love my wife dearly and i know i m lucky to have such an amazing wife in the first place i know that this post sound like i m complaining about something i should be grateful for but i really am confused by the whole thing and i m not sure if i m reading her correctly we ve been married for 3 year and she ha been a stay at home wife not sure what term i m supposed to use that entire time neither of u had lived with a person of the opposite sex before we were married my wife wa a waitress when we were dating and engaged and since my income is a great deal larger than hers wa and since she said she wanted to be a stay at home wife and mother like her mom wa it made sense for u my life is so much happier now thanks to her i have a healthy diet for the first time in my adult life and i feel so much healthier and my home and life is no longer a mess everything run perfectly all thanks to my wife my point is i really appreciate her dedication and hard work it s the best thing in the world to come home to the woman i love everyday to a home that s pristinely clean and organized and well decorated and all i have to worry about is kissing her and eating dinner then we can unwind together the rest of the night it s by far the happiest i ve ever been in life and she say the same thing for herself my close friend who s been married longer than me and ha way more experience with dating and living with a partner than i do said that i should really help my wife with the housework and that he guarantee that my wife need it and will appreciate it and i ve had other people tell me it s ridiculous that i let my wife do everything but my wife ha continually said no thanks honey and seemed dismissive of the idea and she always acted like i couldn t possibly help and she wouldn t want me to over the christmas holiday her parent are staying with u and so i insisted on helping her with everything since i m off work and she got angry about it for the first time she said something like just let me be your wife in an angry and snappy way then she looked guilty and said she wa sorry i don t understand why she is so sensitive about it i think i m just going to appreciate the gift i ve been given and make sure i m a good husband and also keep taking out the trash the only housework she want me to do doe that sound like the thing i should do she just told me she s pregnant last month not due until june so maybe that will require me to help in different way in the near future tl dr my wife is a homemaker and doesn t work outside of the home she doe everything in the house she cook 3 meal every single day that we don t eat out she doe all cleaning she doe all grocery shopping all organizing and even our financial planning i wa told that i should help with housework and that it s ridiculous that i don t but my wife refuse all help with housework and she even got mad when i kept insisting i should help should i just appreciate my good fortune since she just told me she s pregnant will i have to start helping at a point during after pregnancy,0

my 22m girlfriend 21f really pressure me into sleeping naked and i don t like it we ve been together for almost a year now and everything is going really good i ve met her parent and we all generally get along really well except for this one problem from the beginning she slept naked fine by me definitely not complaining at all but i personally don t feel comfortable doing that i usually just wear a large baggy shirt to bed and i gotta wear my boxer cause i kind of have a large package and i don t like having my dick flopping around everywhere i ve explained this to her and i m usually met with well yeah i get it but i still think you should do it this is super frustrating cause she s really stuck on it and won t stop bringing it up last night it wa thanksgiving here in canada and we got wine drink i probably should have talked her out of it because she get really sexually aggressive when she s drunk and i feel like she s pressuring me into doing these thing that i don t want to do well at the end of the night when we were going to bed she tried to pressure me into sleeping naked again and i said no i don t want to we had sex before we went to bed and i got in bed with my baggy shirt and boxer and she wouldn t stop getting on top of me and trying to coerce me into having sex again this really upset me cause i wa totally beat from the day which wa a lot of drinking and activity she wouldn t stop trying to initiate again and each time i had to shove her off me finally i yelled at her and told her to leave me alone and stop pressuring me into shit i didn t wanna do she got super upset said i should never speak to her like that again and called me weird cause everyone sleep naked and i should just suck it up and get over it cause it s not a big deal i just turned over and lay on my stomach and she let me sleep during the middle of the night i woke up with no underwear on and she wa fondling my dick and i wa groggy and had no clue what wa going on i just got up and left to sleep on the couch however i woke up this morning thinking that i don t really feel good about that she violated my boundary and didn t respect them and it s a little bit troubling she can just get aggressive and it s the one thing that really get on my nerve anyways sorry for rambling i don t want to break up with her and i ve not got a clue what to do she s really lovely apart from this and she love me a lot so i can t imagine what to do or where to go from here tl dr my girlfriend won t stop asking me to sleep naked,0

how do i 24f express to my boyfriend 24m how significant sex is to me we ve been dating for around six month and it s been great so far my issue is i m pretty sure we place different level of value on sex i see it a a really important fundamental expression of love and passion i know that s not the case for everyone and i certainly am not suggesting it should be that s just what it mean to me my boyfriend on the other hand enjoys sex but doesn t see it a holding so much significance case in point tonight wa our last night together before we go on separate overseas trip we won t see each other for 2 month in my mind in a situation like this it s almost certain that we would have sex we were cuddling in bed when i tried to initiate he very gently said he wanted to but didn t think it wa appropriate with his housemate at home he life in a large house so it s not like his housemate would hear and we are always very quiet but nonetheless he wa uncomfortable which i fully respected and stopped trying to initiate immediately my problem isn t that i think his perspective wa wrong whilst i personally am comfortable having sex with others in the house i totally understand if others aren t or that i feel like he doesn t want to have sex with me the actual sex itself is great he s the most selfless loving and caring man i ve been with in bed he also initiate most of the time so i know he want to most of the time i am happy with the frequency too however he is happy to go quite a few day without sex if our schedule don t align whereas i will actively prioritise it and change plan to see him if we haven t had sex in a few day later on tonight he said it s not that i don t want to i really like having sex with you whilst that is reassuring it s kind of illustrative of our divergent perspective he see sex a something nice that he just like to do whereas i pretty much need regular sex and especially at significant moment like a last night together before being apart because to me it s more than something i like to do how do i communicate how important sex is to me without pressuring him the last thing i want is to make him feel bad or like he is obligated to have sex with me i just want him to understand what it mean to me alternatively how do i change my perspective so i don t care a much about sex i wa quite upset tonight but tried to hide it a he wa fully reasonable to say no and already felt bad i don t want to be upset this much by something like this so how do i be more casual about sex outside of relationship i have plenty of casual sex that i feel no emotion for but it just seems that whenever i m in a relationship it is suddenly extremely signficiant to me tl dr i have more of an emotional need for sex than my boyfriend how do i express this without pressuring him or implicitly invalidating his perspective on sex,0
where do i go from here i left my abusive husband about a year ago he wa emotionally and sexually abusive for year and only stopped when i threatened to leave and when a therapist intervened even though he ha changed i still feel constantly trapped and manipulated by him i now deal with ptsd anxiety and depression lately it s gotten worse to the point of dissociation i m trying to get on the right med and find a therapist but in the meantime i m considering moving out of state to live with my parent and try to recover emotionally mentally and financially the problem is i have four kid with my ex and no lawyer will help me fight for the right to take the kid out of state since abuse is really hard to prove and judge in missouri prefer to do 50 50 custody i m at the point where i may just have to leave and agree to only having the kid during the summer holiday and hope that eventually he realizes he can t deal with the kid on his own am i making the right decision by doing that my kid have not been abused by him and i have no reason to think they would be since all abuse wa focused on me but i still feel tremendously guilty for leaving my kid even though i know i m not doing them any good in the emotional state that i m in,1

i 30f can t stand my boyfriend s 31m close female friend 22f i apologize in advance for such large wall of text t t my boyfriend met this woman through mutual friend three month before he met me off a dating app in december i ve been told in those three month they became close and he d confide his problem to her she started dating his best friend casually in march his best friend dumped her and she wa devastated she became really needy and started hanging out with u at least once a week i wasn t seeing him often then usually only on weekend so i felt like i wasn t getting enough alone time with him i also didn t understand why she wa always around if my male friend just got into a relationship i d back off and let him spend time with his new girlfriend he also made thing worse by inviting her to what i thought were date and i d find out when we got to the location for example he and i would have plan to go watch a movie she d ask him if he had plan and he d invite her to come along without telling me we would get to the theater and low and behold she d be there this happened a few time and it drove me insane i started noticing they d touch each other more often than i d like he d guide her walking by touching her lower back she d reach over and squeeze his biceps when she wanted his attention she d touch his arm the last straw wa when we went to a rave in may and we met up with her friend my boyfriend and i wanted to see another dj and get some alone time so we told her we d be right back she didn t want u to leave her with her friend but we told her we d be gone only 30 minute when we came back she wa having an anxiety attack and cry that we left her her hand were numb and trembling so she asked him to massage her hand which i thought wa incredibly inappropriate not to mention earlier that night i wa leaning back on him cuddling while listening to one of our favorite song he then put his arm around her so we were in this weird three way cuddle his reasoning wa that he didn t want her to feel left out i confronted him shortly afterward and told him that their relationship made me very uncomfortable i didn t want to make him choose and knowing myself i felt like this wouldn t work because we clearly have different boundary he told me that if he had to choose he d choose me he suggested that i tag along whenever they hang out so i could see that he s not doing anything inappropriate with her i told him i didn t want to do that because i don t like her a a person she s not very bright we don t have much in common and whenever we did hang out she d talk endlessly about her life and not include me making me feel like i m third wheel my boyfriend doesn t talk much and is a good listener so i can see why she enjoys being friend with him but i don t understand how he benefit from the friendship i also don t understand why a 31 year old man want to be friend with a 22 year old woman who are both at completely different phase in life a an outsider doesn t this just appear creepy one red flag i do see is that all her close friend including my boyfriend are from the last 2 3 year most of whom she met at work or the gym she doesn t have one friend from grade school high school or college that she hang out with which i find odd and telling we re all local in a large metropolitan city and grew up within 20 minute of each other it wa at this point he suggested that he maintain a text online friendship and not hang out with her in person anymore i told him i didn t want this but he convinced me to give it a shot there were a couple of time where we had to go to social event and see her which i had no problem with however two week ago i went out of town and he told me he wa going to get brunch with her and her new boyfriend i wa livid to me he broke his word and it made me feel stupid for trusting him he told me that he never wanted to stop hanging out with her and only told me he would to placate me thinking that i would eventually get over it he thought that i wa uncomfortable with her because i thought she possibly liked him more than a friend this wa a passing thought but not my main concern so since she wa in a new relationship it wa okay to see her again we got into a huge fight and due to conflicting work schedule we didn t really talk or see each other for 1 5 week when we finally talked it wa a 6 hour discussion about why i think her action are disrespectful and how he doesn t think they are he doesn t think it s a problem that she asked him to massage her hand because friend help each other out he belief that it come down to trust and if i trusted him this wouldn t be an issue meanwhile i think this ha nothing to do with trust i see her touchiness and behavior a outright disrespect to me and the fact that he doesn t try to negate her behavior by not reciprocating is also disrespectful he s concerned that if it wasn t her it d be someone else and what if some other female come into his life and the same thing happens but i don t have any problem with any of his other female friend just her i don t know i m being naive or if it s because of the age difference but i think most people our age wouldn t behave inappropriately with friend who are in relationship so it wouldn t be an issue to be clear i don t think she ha ill intention i truly think she s young and naive but it s not my job to tell her what s appropriate and not however i didn t want to give up without trying so i suggested i have a talk with her a few hour have passed and i m having second thought back in may he actually suggested this but i didn t want to because i didn t think it would make a difference maybe she ll surprise me but i know so many people who either become defensive or agree apologize but keep doing what they re doing i also don t want to be cast a the villain or crazy girlfriend am i overreacting clearly he and i don t see eye to eye on what s appropriate and not so is this a dealbreaker i feel very

dating after abuse am i emotionally unavailable hey again guy i m two year out of a six year abusive relationship and i don t know if i m just incapable of loving anymore or what but i m confused just for some background i jumped way too quickly into a relationship earlier this year that had it own little red flag when i told people about it later like him saying i love you first after four straight day of hanging out with me but at the time i wa just so desperate for someone anyone to love me that i took it and ran with it only for that to blow up in my face four month down the line when his 19 year old coworker came into the picture while i wa gone it wa a long distance thing off topic but a 29 m year old just should not be messing with a 19 f year old i m 25 f for the record here i m guessing it s because he noticed that i m a human lie detector and he knew he couldn t manipulate someone close to his age but idk so anyways since then i ve been focusing on myself completely and just writing working on my art and preparing to go back to school so i can get out of my dead end job but it s hard not to feel left out when you re on social medium frequently for my art especially and you see friend and former classmate getting engaged married what have you i try really hard not to pay it any mind but i don t know i personally have this mentality of why them and not me what did i do to deserve the bullshit i ve had i want to have a happy loving relationship too i know it s awfully childish i also recognize that because i m an empath i naturally attract what you would term a broken people such a narcissist manipulator whatever and after dating for some time i ve gotten a little bit better at weeding out those guy still not 100 perfect but the problem is that occasionally i will find someone who i enjoy going on date with and they re kind and normal but i feel no ounce of anything for them case in point i went to the movie with one of these guy last night this is our second time going on a date and he put his arm around me at some point during the movie which wasn t bad but i kinda got stiff i didn t say anything but i did mention to him that perhaps we should slow down in that aspect until i m used to him the problem is that i ve never been averse to physical touch like hug and simple thing like that but now i am this guy and a few others i ve gone on date with have checked off the box for everything i m looking for but the problem is that i don t feel anything did i finally get fucked up enough to the point where i can never have a normal relationship again i feel like mentally the last relationship i wa in with that 29 year old must have been the final straw for my head or something because i just feel emotionally numb when it come to stuff like dating now he wasn t abusive but finding out about the coworker who also had a boyfriend at the time just messed me up especially because we d initially agreed to make this long distance thing work out and he knew about my abusive relationship and how my ex loved to cheat on me i am going to therapy for my past abusive relationship to deal with the ptsd and i am trying to unlearn the unhealthy behavior i picked up i just don t know why i m completely numb with potential partner now i m sorry for the ramble and just kind of word vomiting here but this ha been a genuine concern of mine because i can t put a finger on why i feel like this is this what being emotionally unavailable mean tl dr after a six year abusive relationship and then a four month relationship two year post abuse that ended up in cheating i feel emotionally numb when it come to dating with nice normal people but i also want an s o thanks to social medium something s wrong but i don t know what,1
my bf s ex want him back wall of text incoming tl dr at the top tl dr met a guy recently out of a serious ltr and he hasn t stopped talking to his ex who want to get back together what do a few month ago i 28f met my current boyfriend 27m he s recently out of a longterm serious relationship 7 year that ended pretty badly and wasn t the best from what he s told me he and his ex split about three and a half week before we started talking and dating he s been nothing but a dream in the relationship so far we align very well in every way we communicate well our chemistry in and out of the bedroom is incredible he s the kindest sweetest hottest most patient and wonderful person i ve ever dated far and away i can t speak highly enough of him and i m falling for him more and more each day we ve been together almost four month and we ve exchanged i love you s although i m not sure how much weight that carry for either of u in the relationship now here s the issue since he and his ex were together for so long they built a life together had two cat together credit card a loan together etc needle to say their life are intertwined so his ex is going to be in his life in some capacity for a while now the issue for me stem from the fact that his ex is still trying to get my boyfriend back together again my bf expressed to me that he still care for his ex deeply and wish them wl but doe not have any interest in a relationship with them again he s very happy with me to the point of being worried the rug is gonna be pulled out from under him so i trust and believe him i may have snooped and read their convo it confirms my fear they know we re together and don t care his ex also currently ha his cat for the week a her cat missed her sibling which really rub me the wrong way my boyfriend shut it down initially and ha done pretty well although there ha been a series of message exchange where the ex asked to just get married like they planned and my bf responded i don t know it s all too much for me right now when asked if he loved me he said i care deeply for her but i m not in love with her his ex kept pushing for him to consider them together again and his response i need some time to think i don t know what i want or what i feel i can t i don t know how long it will take but i know i can t right now sidenote they ve met up a few time outside of the cat exchange and he s deliberately avoided telling me when they re together he just doesn t text me for hour which is out of the ordinary it s frustrating but i feel powerless because i can t ask her to cut contact or anything like that so here i am i wish i d never read those message but i did and i m a bit glad that my anxiety wasn t unfounded this absolutely crushed me i know it s fucking early to be this hurt but here i am i feel like i m just the rebound while his ex got their shit together this feel incredibly reactionary and i know we re still in the honeymoon stage but i had hope that he could be the real deal someone i could see myself with long term hell i probably still could if we figured this out he is everything i value in a partner amd the thing i didn t know i needed i get it it s still early on but this worry the hell out of me he s been nothing short of incredible a a bf and ha given me nothing to stress about other than this i ve been thinking about this for day now and i spoke with a friend about it i think it feel like they never broke up and are just on a break and i m the rebound but that s not what i want i ve never felt this good about a relationship or this strongly for a person how do i proceed is this worth pursuing give it time and discus cut my loss and hope i find someone with their baggage more behind them,0

i 25m believe i m in a toxic relationship with my 21f girlfriend who may be mentally ill i apologize in advance if this is too much but i m really in quite the situation about a year and a half ago i traveled home for the holiday i lived in another state at the time and met this girl during a night out who i quickly became interested in we started a long distance relationship soon after and a few month later i found a new job and moved back to my home state a the relationship started getting more serious i started to learn more about her and her past she s come from a broken home where her dad left her family at a very early age and her mother shipped her from home to home because she wa mentally unfit to raise child she s been abused and neglected over her entire life and the person she loved and lived with the most her aunt died during her pre teen year this is only a small part of it but she s experienced way more trauma than someone should in life about a month after i move back to my hometown i move in with her and soon find out that she s pregnant she wa ecstatic to become a mother and honestly i wa terrified but i knew i d try my best to be the father possible we ve had our occasional argument but it started getting to be overwhelming once my daughter wa born she seemed to snap at the slightest thing i d do and it would escalate to her telling me to move out it s getting to the point to where i can look at her the wrong way and she throw my belonging out the door and threatens to call the cop if i don t leave granted i m not perfect at all and have my fault a well but i ve never threatened to leave or threatened the relationship finally about a month ago i convinced her to see a doctor about possibly being depressed she understands how bad she can get at some point doctor diagnosed her with depression anxiety and bipolar disorder to which she wa prescribed medication for about the same time is when she would see a therapist once a week this past weekend wa the worst it ha ever gotten between u we were enjoying our night together after the baby wa put to sleep i put on some music and boom she sprint to the bedroom and tell me to sleep on the couch that night i wa taken completely by surprise about an hour later she come to the living room and start yelling at me about me sleeping on the couch even though she told me to in the first place she eventually tell me to leave which i said i didn t want to she throw my key at me and tell me how she is going to call the cop if i don t leave at that point i grab my thing and head toward the door and she then shove me from behind and tell me how she wish she could punch me in the jaw and that my child deserves a better father i left and stayed at a friend house since then i ve been staying at my friend place she realizes what she did and the thing she said were wrong and that she will continue to get help it s just difficult for me because i ve been experiencing this behavior of verbal abuse for month now and it seems to only be getting worse over time just yesterday she accused me of cheating on her because i wouldn t have left her so easily i want it to work out because i loved who she wa when we first met and i love my child more than anything but it s getting increasingly difficult to stay in a situation where i have to walk on eggshell so my so doesn t get sent into a rage tldr started a long distance relationship and soon fell in love so ha a traumatic upbringing moved back home to be with her she got pregnant and soon after birth she wa diagnosed with mental illness she go off on me and into a rage for small thing and it only seems to be getting worse even after therapy and medication,0

my best friend 27f didn t invite me 27f to her bachelorette am i overreacting by feeling so upset that i m considering ending the friendship lot of context year in fact that i will attempt to boil down here my best friend and i met in college when the school assigned u to be roommate we come from vastly different background hers is very rural very conservative not especially diverse mine is urban very diverse very liberal with vastly different friend group but we ve always cared for and been there for each other we are now more than five year out of college but over those almost 9 year of friendship we ve lived with each other gotten to know each other s partner gotten engaged i literally got engaged a month ago and i ve always still seen her a holding a big place in my life i spent last christmas with her family my fiancee called her to ask her which ring to get and the day i got engaged she wa my second call after my mom that doe not mean that thing are perfect between u and i m wondering if this latest thing is enough to end our friendship on when it come to our history there ha always been an undercurrent of tension with u there wa the time we trained to hike a 60 mile trail and then she canceled a week before two month later she hiked that trail with a few other girl there wa time we were supposed to go camping and she never met up with u at the campsite leaving u without essential that were packed in her car there is a history of her flaking on me not following through etc because she prioritizes her hometown friend a few year ago she left the city that we went to college in and returned home which is 5 hour away and where she went on to date her fiancee and stay near the people she grew up with lately though thing have been good largely because the distance ha allowed u to grow independently and lot of the flakiness hasn t happened because we just aren t relying on each other anymore we text nearly daily sending meme and recipe random thought about work etc so color me shocked when i see an instagram post from her sister early wednesday talking about how excited she wa to celebrate my friend s bachelorette my heart dropped i decided not to say anything because maybe it wa just family some context here is that earlier in the year she had told me that i wa no longer a bridesmaid because of family issue and that she wouldn t be doing traditional bridesmaid anymore that it would be just her sister and her fiancee s sister i felt kind of bad then but i had put it away anyway so i waited i waited to see if it wa just family but it turn out that she invited about 8 girl to celebrate with her this weekend at a mountain town fairly close to the city i live in where we went to college together because i ve been in her life for so long i know these girl very well and all are from her small hometown with the exception of her cousin and another friend watching their social medium this weekend ha left me feeling so hurt and so confused my friend who know u reached out to me wondering why i am not there why wouldn t she say anything to me about it when we text so dang much the only thing that multiple folk have suggested is that maybe this is an image thing her whole group are all very thin blonde with matching cowboy boot and dress i am none of those thing i m tall i m latina i m overweight and i tend to choose overall and birkenstocks over tiny glittery dress and cowboy boot it is a really hurtful thought that i know i will never confirm but it s hard to not see how they all look the same and then there s me i ve never really fit in her friend group physically or emotionally but it s really hard to not see it here the weekend then passed i reached out to her when she returned home and said that i m glad to see that she had fun but that i wa surprised and hurt and confused that i wasn t there i honestly did not want to confront her about it at all but i ultimately knew that i needed to understand what had happened she responded completely defensively saying that it wa a surprise from her bridal party remember how she told me earlier in the year that her bridal party wa just family and that i ve made her feel bad after she had spent the weekend being so happy i responded by saying that i never wanted her to feel bad that i love her and i care about her and i want her to be happy but that it s about more than just not being invited to a party it s about not being included in this overall celebration of someone who ha been so close to me for so long i told her again that i cared about our friendship that i do not say this lightly and that i hope to talk to her about it i never heard from her and it s been over a week now i guess my question here is what do i do i am so angry at myself for being so hurt by this i wish i didn t care and i wish i understood i don t want to feel like a child who is upset about not being invited to party and i don t much care to be a cliche who end a friendship during someone s wedding festivity i feel terrible about the prospect of driving five hour for her wedding in a month especially because i ll have to see her bridesmaid up there when i wa one only like 7 or 8 month ago and i wa told that she wasn t doing them anywhere i ll be so angry do i need to end this friendship should i just send her a card and not go to the wedding tldr my close friend who despite our vast difference in lifestyle and background didn t invite me to her bachelorette weekend i m hurt and there s a history of this should i end this friendship,0
my 28m girlfriend 37f is friend with her ex and i m uncomfortable so we ve been dating for a year and i knew going into this that she wa close friend with her ex they had dated on and off for 5 year and were very close before they were romantic we ve had talk about their relationship and she ha clearly communicated that it is important that she continues a friendship with her ex which i said i wa fine with she ha also mentioned that a part of her will always love her ex that s the part that is hard for me my girlfriend is very communicative and i love her for that but that one wa rough to hear she say she doesn t want a romantic relationship with her ex but that person is very important to her and they will be in her life forever i completely trust my girlfriend and trust that if romantic feeling were to develop that she would feel comfortable telling me but i don t feel comfortable with them texting that they miss each other the ex doesn t live in the same state so they don t see each other often when i ask about it she say she missing her friendship and seeing them regularly i guess i m looking for input on how to talk about the subject what are realistic expectation etc any advice would be great i want to work through this and would love to hear from people with experience in similar situation thanks tl dr my girlfriend is close friend with an ex and told me upfront that a part of her will always love her ex doe anyone have experience with this situation how did you navigate it,0

hoping this will make me feel better sort of a rant i ve 26 been with my partner 24 for about two year we have had a lot of problem and we ve tried working on them but it s a lost cause they ve been physical with me multiple time but after it happens i start feeling so embarrassed that i would even allow this to happen to me again and again i haven t told anyone about this because i m just too embarrassed and afraid people will look at me different why do people do this to other people they say that it s me because i push and push and push them so much that they end up chocking me smashing my face pulling my hair and punching me i m not saying i m the nicest and kindest person ever when i m upset but i would never hurt anyone physically i just want to know what i did to deserve this and i am feeling very hurt and ashamed,1

my 26m dad 61m call me everyday to give me unsolicited advice this is harming my self esteem so this is an issue i ve been having for a long time now my dad 61m will call me 26m up sometimes twice a day to have a catch up about what ha happened during the day most time this will include telling me what he ha been up to and seeking validation for his choice this is something that he used to do with my grandfather his dad and is something that he whole heartedly expects without exception over the year he ha done this and ha asked question about issue i ve been having the problem is that he then force advice on me how to resolve the situation i never even asked for this advice and he get offended if i don t follow the advice last week he called me up and told me that the food i wa making for a date i wa having wa wrong food would get stuck in her teeth and she would end up being uncomfortable this kind of thing really make me doubt my choice and i end up feeling really low about myself this is of course just a small example but when it is to do with everything it becomes a big issue the biggest problem time for this is when i wa at university and he would relentlessly call me daily demanding i got a job or tell him what i wa up to i started lying to try and meet his expectation and eventually he found out and thing got worse this is a common theme for his relationship a people tend to start being dishonest just to make thing easy i cut him out of my life for a full year but my family forced u back together a they thought he wa sad i don t know what to do at this point it s just too much i don t want my life to be this way is there an easy way to get him to back off without causing a fued tl dr my dad call me everyday to give me unsolicited advice that is having a negative effect on my self esteem and i can t get out of this negative cycle,0
long thread from an aggressor hello i began hitting my partner 2 month after our son wa born our only child he is now 2 year 8 month old my partner left me on sunday the first time she arrived at our house with her family and took our son it wa a tense situation but i could see our son wa upset so i pretended everything wa ok and agreed to let her take him to calm the situation down we have been together 5 year up until our son wa born i never reacted how i do every 6 week or so there have been occasion in the last 3 year where i have slapped her and honestly believed she deserved it these reaction are a a result of her doing some wrong and then continuing to do the same thing incorrectly for example she changed our son nappy in a really lazy way did not bother cleaning him properly i originally spoke to her about this twice and then saw her doing it again and i snapped when i slap her she normally retaliated much worse pick up object throw them damage furniture threw a tv at me it is always me who is the first to resort to something physical but i never do more than slap her i m not downplaying what i do or condoning it the last episode she stabbed me with car key i don t understand what is going on here but here is some back history which may provide some idea a to how i can solve this firstly for 2 5 year we were pretty good but we had argument but instead of talking about problem or being honest my partner would go silent and be unresponsive this would prompt me to leave i would leave for a couple of day and we would solve the issue through text then our son wa born and i am dead against walking out she s a good mother but she is a little bit lazy if i m not around and she ha a tendency to do a job the easy way and not the correct way in her defence she is from a very different environment than the one we live in she wa brought up on a farm in thailand her education level is low the family she is from are very poor and they just do thing very differently to how i expect thing to be done we have always lived in city and where we live now is ordinary in the western sense it s westernized enough that the easy way is no longer the accepted environment and the correct way to do thing is evident all around u she speaks and read english very well she ha always found it very difficult to talk about thing especially problem she cannot make a distinction between a fear and a real concern she think if she think it or hears it it must be true i know that sound very odd but it s true there is never a critical thought about anything she think or hears admitting she made a mistake is non existent she is also extremely poor at making decision i am serious about the decision she put load of salt in our child s food for two week and did not realise the error even though he wa sick every time she fed him i had to guide her through some nutrition website to prove to her she wa making a mistake throughout that two week she never thought about the possibility of her food being the issue she thought it tasted good so she assumed child would i tasted it and immediately knew the issue she did learn from this error i never reacted badly this is just an example of why perhaps i fear walking away i hate quitter i really have a problem with people who give up too easily and unfortunately my partner give up on thing very quickly i cannot detail all these example but there s a lot i loved this woman and when we met i explained to her that i would always stand by her but she must always learn my belief here is that she is not dumb she s just uneducated and not had many opportunity in life so this last 5 year i have supported her completely and i have no issue doing this but if you make the same mistake 3 4 time and do not learn from it it becomes increasingly frustrating i think it s me and she just doe not want to learn anymore and she ignores my advice on purpose i feel like a failure who instead of bringing her up in the world the opposite ha happened and i ve come down to her level i have done everything right besides slapping her i spend weekend devoted to them both we have saving for our future education fund for our son we have put real plan in place i don t drink much at all i litrually make every decision with them at the forefront of each decision i wa an angry kid i left home at 12 year old i grew up in child s home wa homeless at 23 i quit heroin on my own with no medication took a chance in a company at 25 that ha seen me grow up a lot i ve always had good long term relationship i ve grew a business and successfully transitioned it 6000 mile around the world but i cannot get though to the person who i have supported more than anyone ha in their life i got her driving lesson brought her car when she passed i have changed this woman s life exponentially we are close in age i m 38 she s 36 were also compatible in the bedroom believe it or not when it s good it is really good between u but after a few week i sense she becomes lazy and we just break down and i snap i see more sense in being uneasy with each other seems to me we both work better when we are not too friendly i even say we do need to be friend we just need to raise our son right she is a good mother my son love his mom to bit and he love me too a lot and he is really well developed but if a mistake get made it never acknowledged unless i raise it i really have no issue with mistake but pretending they do not happen doe not seem to be a good way to learn not to make them i m brutally honest but this slapping thing i ve really let myself down and feel i have allowed it to become a phase in our relationship which ha gradually creeped into our life more and more i have caught myself defending my action and quickly justifying them to myself i need to understand how to solve this i will not walk away from them unless they requested this i don t think this will happen i just cannot do it in my mind i have to figure out how to get self control back i ve tried a lot with her forum for answer buddhist quote to understand mistake are not bad book for writing reminder cataloguing learning and progress i need to change this i gotta solve this i m no good alone i need them please hurt me,1
i 27f don t know what to do with my fiance s 29m strange addiction to doll nsfw i ve googled everything and looked at several reddits pertaining to this situation but i no longer know what to do in 2015 i met the love of my life he s kind smart caring and i wa his first ever girlfriend he took great care of me even when i wa in a terrible home situation and doesn t mind how clingy i am or my sexual prowess even though he wa a virgin at our time of meeting about six month into our relationship post sex he let me in on the personal matter that he s owned around six of those cheap blow up anime doll that he s been buying since college we re both huge anime fan so this didn t really strike me a odd honestly i enjoy watching hentai myself so i wasn t embarrassed or anything i assured him that nothing wa wrong with it and joked that he had me now no problem eight month into our relationship we got into an argument about how much time he wa spending with his friend during a month of not hanging out at all we lived twenty minute away from each other at the time and he got so mad at the whole situation because it happened in front of his friend he s a very private person he dropped me off at home and drove off in the morning i called him and apologized and he confessed to me that he cheated last night i got angry at the amount of time it took him to find another girl so quickly until he reassured me that it wa with an anime sex doll but i wa still very upset a little about me i ended up getting a stressful management job a year into our relationship and gained around 60 pound it wa very embarrassing and needle to say i didn t have a high self esteem a i did when i first met him but i still trusted him not to cheat leave because our bond is really something amazing i also should add that i have a big fear of human sized inanimate thing with face i m terrible around huge halloween and christmas blow up decoration even though halloween is my favorite holiday don t even invite me to a wax museum or you know any type of museum i did a google it s called automatonophobia a year and a half into our relationship we moved in together and i told him that we cannot have the doll in our apartment he promptly threw them away but kept their box a keepsake we ve had a very prominent sex life upon moving in together i ve had no complaint a he wa very compatible with my need he wa a virgin besides the doll so them and i gave him all the tool needed to satisfy he joked a lot about getting a realdoll you know the 3000 silicone one but i ve always knocked him down not only because of my fear but the self esteem issue kept coming up i asked him if he d be okay with a regular bust bottom part one without a head but he said that creep him out i ve also caught him masturbating a few time to the doll catalogue online he quit all that stuff when he proposed in march of this year around september of this year we decided to break up due to him not being emotionally available we stopped having sex for three month prior he barely wanted to spend time with me and i wa diagnosed with pcos which make it very hard to have child it s been a very turbulent year but we decided to mend thing around the end of the same month fast forward to last night i asked him why don t we ever had sex anymore and he said he wa waiting for marriage i probed him a bit more and he looked away before confessing that he missed the doll and would rather have sex with them i ve lost 40 pound earlier this year and asked him if it wa because of me and he claimed that it had nothing to do with his attraction to me he liked the quietness of the doll i m loud in bed he liked the coldness inside of them i m a human being he liked the all around tightness and feel of them i wa no virgin when we met but really and finally he always dreamed of having an anime girlfriend and that s the reason why he wanted a face when we moved in together i found out that he doesn t watch real porn at all i ve never to this day seen him look at anything but anime drawing on rule 34 43 and very rarely hentai he literally cried while explaining this to me and this guy never cry so i know he s being very serious i ve tried to make compromise like if he didn t want to have sex with me maybe an open relationship and he can get his doll but he also doesn t want me sleeping around and no i am very much not into doll so that s not for me and i am actually very uncomfortable with him getting a super dolled up realdoll with their long hair and unrealistic proportion and to have it trigger my automatonophobia and i have no problem finding gentleman suitor i ve shooed them all at this point we are very much in love but our sex life is suffering he claim he want to get better even though he s gone two year without the doll but he said to me in tear that it s not been easy and he still ha the craving for doll he fell asleep but to humour myself i watched lars and the real girl to try and understand him but the movie character ryan gosling play and my fiance are very different my fiance make friend with anyone even though he wa rejected a lot by girl the rejection and anime hentai drawing is what made him get the doll in the first place he cried while apologizing to me and saying sorry he messed himself up before he met me i ve asked him to consider therapy but he said it s a waste of money i asked him to talk to his parent who actually knew about this addiction of his before i did and he said it wa too embarrassing i m looking for way to go about this and help him so

i think my nex just threatened suicide but i m not sure he s made some desperate hoovering attempt the past few week even sending money to my venmo bank i sent them back and told him to stop contacting me for like the third time because he somehow found out that my pet wa sick and i had a pretty huge bill from the vet he ha not respected my wish and today he contacted me again and told me i can live with the fact that i don t get to see you again but not if it s because some rumour that aren t true the rumour he is talking about is when i asked him how many time he had cheated on me because of 1 obvious evidence i found recently and in the past 2 stuff i had heard around town i told him once again to stop contacting me calling me sending me money or i would block his number and his reply wa i ll make sure you wont get to hear from me again it s a bit hard to translate from swedish but pretty much those word and i feel like it s a threat maybe i am just overreacting but he mentioned how he couldn t live with not seing me because of a rumour that isn t true he s also been sending me text about how he hate his life and stuff like that the reason i haven t blocked his number yet wa to gather evidence if he would stalk harass me because i wa feeling like he might do that and i would like to have some sort of evidence to show the police if i would file for a restraining order now i regret not blocking him even though i haven t answered his call and the only message i ve sent him wa telling him to stop contacting me am i overreacting or is this a threat i know he is trying to manipulate me but to be honest i wa the only thing keeping his life together he haven t cooked or cleaned or anything for a very long time his house is a mess and i am pretty sure his drug and alcohol abuse got worse after we broke up he forgot to eat sleep missed appointment and stuff like that when we were together i had to bring him food at his workplace or else he would barely eat i am not mentioning his severe abuse here because i am very overwhelmed right now and i just recently opened up to my family and therapist about the abuse he also contacted my mother yesterday and told her he wa sad about her removing him on facebook my mother told me to ignore his threat but i know he had a suicide attempt many year ago unless that wa another lie i know he is depressed and narcissistic and this is the first time in many many year i have abandoned him for good even though he wa the one breaking up with me while i wa hospitalized and had some lady sleep over at his place the same day he dumped me and i basically just thanked my lucky star for the fact that he left me again when i wa too weak to do it myself he of course regretted his decision and now that i am finally 100 done he is freaking out tldr i feel like my abusive ex threatened suicide do i overreact should i call his sister or the cop what would you do,1

am i 38f being unfair that i want to end my relationship with my 37m live in bf of 11 year because of financial reason originally posted this at r relationship_advice but it got removed for asking for moral judgement my bf and i have been together for almost 11 year and live together in a house we bought 9 year ago ownership is 50 50 not married no kid despite having a very large income discrepancy he make 3 5 time what i make we each pay half of the mortgage utility and insurance we have our own separate account and a joint account on which we both deposit our monthly half this is only for housing cost grocery and everything else is paid from our own separate account when we bought the house he already made more than i did but the difference wa way le than it is now we couldn t get a loan for the full price of the house and had to pay around 10 out of pocket i paid that 10 around 35 000 euro with money that wa gifted to me by my parent they had gotten an inheritance and split the money in 3 me my brother and themselves my bf and i decided that we would do 60 40 for the amount of money we were putting into the joint account from which our housing cost are paid it s not like we both had an equal amount of money left to spend after paying our half he had around 1200 left i had around 800 left not a big problem for me plus back then everything pointed towards me making more money in the near future at the end of the first year of living together i wa expecting a tax return for the mortgage rate deduction which we have here which should have been around 5500 euro the tax return is in one person s name which is his the reason for this is that the tax return is higher if deducted from the highest income but i had expected u to split the return when i asked my bf about it he wa surprised or acted surprised and told me he had already gotten the return in monthly payment which is possible here when i asked him where to money wa he said he already spent it and had just used it to live because it wa his money and in his name him telling me this led to our first big fight i thought this wa very unfair not only had he not discussed this at all now i wa paying more than i had counted on and i wa actually paying around 150 more than he did so i still had 800 a month left after paying for my half and he had around 1650 left instead of 1200 he had more left than i made had we also split the tax return 40 60 it would have been around 1000 a month left for me and 1475 for him i also reminded him that i had paid 35 000 to be able to buy the house his reasoning wa that what he did wa fair he wa paying le than me per month now but in the year to come the tax return would become le and eventually he would be paying more so it would level out for the last 4 5 year or so he ha been with the smaller tax return been paying around 50 euro a month more than i do he also said i shouldn t count in the 35 000 because it wa money that wa given to me i didn t work for it and it wa my choice to use it i did offer to use it by the way but i had imagined our financial distribution a bit different he told me his opinion is that we should each pay an equal share for expense we have a a couple and that it isn t fair to expect one partner to pay more for something that is for both everyone is responsible for their own income in hindsight i maybe should have walked at this point but i didn t the more i thought about it the more i thought he had a point and that it wasn t fair to expect someone to just give me money basically i even felt guilty for expecting him to pay more by now i m not so sure anymore but i still feel guilty for wishing he would i guess i thought that a our relationship moved along it would get different a lot ha happened since we bought the house and my future didn t turn out the way i expected i got sick i have ehlers danlos syndrome with chiari malformation and syringomyelia basically this cause a lot of nervous system problem including severe headache dizziness and weakness i m doing ok but a my work involved quite a lot of physical effort i had to quit that and i am unable to work 40 hour a week i do still work around 20 hour a week this off course did mean i had even le income than before yet i m still expected to pay my full half of expense his income ha gone up quite a bit right now after paying my half i have around 400 a month left he ha around 2400 left out of this 400 a month i also have to buy grocery and pay half of everything that need replaced for example broken washing machine i have to pay half too i can t buy new clothes he go shopping at least once every month he spends every dime he make and ha no saving when i tell him that s not a very good idea he point out i have no saving either which of course is true about the grocery i buy most of those basically all normal food and household item he doe go grocery shopping once a week but pretty much buy thing i can t afford luxury food and liquor he spends a much on a small shopping basket a i spend on a full cart but because he spends the same amount of money he insists we pay 50 50 towards grocery when i ask him to buy normal grocery he tell me he doesn t know what to get to cook a meal he doesn t cook also because he doesn t know how to i do 90 of the housework he sometimes tidy up a bit and will load unload the washing machine dryer and dishwasher he will clean and vacuum if i ask him to but will never do anything on his own initiative and always want very specific instruction i can t just tell him to clean the kitchen for example because i need to tell him in detail every thing that need to be cleaned and what cleaning supply to use honestly i wouldn t mind doing all the housework if that meant he contributed more financially in exchange but he doesn t i just get told that everyone is responsible for their own income and that he chooses to work more than i do so he make more and ha more to spend off course i tell him that i can t work more it s physically hard enough a it is and it s not a if i don t want to work more i also tell him that if i didn t have to do almost all of the housework the cooking and grocery shopping i could work a bit more and earn more and that imo he profit from me doing all that too to which he say i should work more and we should get a housekeeper and he will pay half or he will pay me half of what he would pay a housekeeper for the hour a spend doing housework the second option really rubbed me the wrong way but but i feel bad for feeling that way a if i m feeling entitled to more of someone else s money than they re willing to give i have even proposed moving to a smaller house which also would make a difference of a couple 100 euro a month for me but still our livestyles would remain very different morally i don t think i can demand him to just give me money for being his partner but i also can t imagine seeing someone you love and live with constantly struggle to just get by and doing nothing to make it easier yet he doe say he feel bad for me when he see me struggle i ve cried over it a lot at first and will hold me and tell me it s going to be alright but doesn t do anything i feel like a roommate more than a partner when it come to finance and that off course doe have it effect on other aspect of the relationship over the past few year i have started to resent him for it to be honest he tell me he couldn t help it that i got sick and can t help that i make le than he doe and off course he couldn t but neither could i my irritation over our finance and the constant financial struggle have pretty much made my love for him disappear yes i will be just a miserable financially on my own maybe even more but at least then i won t have to constantly look at someone living like a prince while i live like a pauper that is how i feel now and at the same time i feel petty and jealous for thinking that like i want to leave him just because he doesn t give me money whoever read this very long post thank you i really needed to get this off my chest and write it down i would appreciate some insight am i wrong for feeling like i do tl dr my bf of 11 yr not married no kid bought a house together 9 year ago and kind of agreed to both pay half of all cost my financial situation ha taken a dive mostly because of chronic illness his ha improved and he now make 3 5 time what i make but still expects me to pay half leaving me struggling financially and him with 2000 euro a month to spend freely to me this feel unfair and it ha made me resent him for it but at the same time i feel petty for wanting to leave him because he won t share his money,0
did doe anyone think that therapy didn t doesn t help you i wa in an abusive relationship not long ago although it feel like a long time 1 5 year ago and the relationship wa 1 5 year long after he wa arrested for domestic violence and rape and after i got a restraining order against him it wa suggested by the police officer handling my case to see a therapist so i did i didn t really feel like he helped me and i saw him for 6 month and i just felt like i just needed some time to think on my own so i did for a year which come to right now there are time where i sort of feel the after effect of what happened to me but for the most part i feel alright i have a steady job progressed well in my career made friend and for the most part moved on i thought just to have a general check in with a therapist a new one to see if i could do anything with the moment where i sort of feel not so good about what happened he told me that he see no progress in my development and that i am regressing by isolating myself i don t go out a much a i used to to be honest that kind of made me upset because personally i d felt that i d come a long way from what had happened to me and to hear that i wa regressing within the first session of therapy seemed far fetched i don t know he s said that i should be in therapy for longer and that i m not ready for a relationship all within the first 50 minute of meeting me i m a little on the fence about going back into therapy because the last time i felt like it did nothing to help me and that i d helped myself more on my own i do have to see him again this week for another session a i ve already paid for it but in the long run i feel like i m not really comfortable with seeing one ha anyone ever experienced anything similar post abusive relationship with their therapist have you found it better to work through thing on your own,1

i 39m love watching movie and television show but my partner 29f insists that we watch everything together preface i know this is light weight stuff compared to a lot of the stuff in this sub it s probably going to seem really petty or insignificant but i really am struggling with this and would like some honest advice i love watching movie and all kind of television show we live in a golden age of content and it s my jam my partner of several year like many of the same kind of movie and show i do but she isn t a passionate about watching thing she doesn t particularly like going out a much to the movie and she get bored with longer show easily or check out while we watch them and then complains that they aren t interesting she ha to be in just the right mood to watch certain show and insists we finish a series together before moving on to something else even if she isn t actually enjoying it she isn t motivated to consume content very quickly but at the same time she is crazy about someone else possibly spoiling something she hate watching something if she know someone else in the room ha seen it before her even if they are completely silent about it she get very grumpy when other people discus something she might one day watch even vaguely she ll get upset hearing even the tiniest most irrelevant factoid about it even for a show that is several year old she will get verbally loud and upset if someone start to talk about it and ha actually left a house party to avoid hearing about something when her demand to shut down the conversation were ignored i have a whole queue of dozen of movie and show that i m not allowed to watch until we watch them together some of them are literally 3 year old at this point we each have our own streaming profile but she ha made comment about thing in my queue like make sure you don t watch that without me or why is this in recently watched you aren t watching any new episode are you one time i went to the cinema by myself while she wa out of town and watched a movie she and i had never discussed or talked about some week later i mentioned in passing to someone else that i d enjoyed the film she wa upset that i wa talking about it and i got griped at for a week after for seeing it without her she insists to this day that she still want to watch the movie but refuse to do so because i ve already seen it so these day i find myself just simply not mentioning or expressing interest in anything that i am excited about because i know she ll lock it down and i won t get to watch it for month if not year instead i watch it at work or when she s not around and then just have to make sure i never mention seeing it it s ridiculous what s a reasonable compromise tl dr my girlfriend hate spoiler but doesn t want to watch show quickly she s super controlling about what i can and cannot watch with her and it s wearing me out,0

i do almost all of the housework and i m lonely because my boyfriend doesn t want to be with me or help me with chore he also keep me awake at night me 19f and my boyfriend 20m live together we ha e been together over 2 year now we both study at university but my school day are much more time consuming and tiring i go to school every day and the day are 7 8 hour long and my bf s are only 2 3 h long and he doesn t have school every day so the problem is that my bf doesn t help me to do the housework i always have to tell him what to do and he still doesn t do the work i give him i do the dish budget make food clean up the house etc we have a checklist of the thing we have to do every week but still i do almost everything sometimes i tell him what to do and he get angry at me and start complaining about my attitude he usually say something like that you don t have a permission to tell me what to do you can t control me i do what i want yes i can say i m strict but i think that it is ok to assume that we must do the housework that way that the chore are separated evenly for both of u not for me only i ve tried to talk with him about it and he say he understands and tell me that he will take part in the housework but after a week or two we have to do the same conversation again because he is not helping me in the housework and then he start to pretend that he hasn t understood anything and blame me about that he say that it is my own problem that he doesn t help me and say that he doesn t care if we don t have food or money or clean plate fork etc the second thing he doe what make the situtation even worse is the way he sleep he can sleep 16 hour straight or stay awake whole night and sleep the day when he is awake in the night he interrupt me trying to sleep because he stomp throw thing around curse laugh and play game which make loud sound a i said i have long day in school and i have to get up before 7am in the morning but because of my bf i sometimes get only a few hour sleep per night and i still have to do all the housework school and homework when i ask him to be quiet at night he get mad at me and start complaining that i took his freedom and say that i am manipulating his life nowadays we don t have time together at all because he stay awake in the night and want to sleep in the morning i d like to spend time with him and thats why i usually stay awake in the night to be with him even though i know i have an early morning the next day he doesn t do the same for me and sleep over the time when i m awake i had a long day in school today and i asked in the morning if my bf would go to the store and buy food so when i ll be back home i can start making food right away he promised but now i am home again but the fridge is empty i sent my bf a message where i asked where the food is and he tell me that it is my own problem if i m hungry what to do i m so tired and have thought of dropping off school because i can t handle this much work and loneliness talking about thing with my bf is not helping i feel like a maid not a girlfriend how can i get him to participate how can i spend time with him how can i be nicer for him i feel like i m the reason the situtation is like that i fell like i m the problem and if it is important for you to know yes i am mad at him yes i have made mistake too and yes i am strict for him about the housework because i have tried averything but it seems that nothing else help than to force him to do at least one chore i don t know what to do anymore and i don t want to be mean to my bf i love him but i m so tired of everything tldr my bf doesn t do housework and i have to do it all even though i m having a tiring time with university study he keep me awake at night so i m much more tired after that,0
my 22f mother s long term boyfriend 35 m insists on referring to me a his daughter i don t like it is it too late to ask him to stop my mother 39f ha been in a serious relationship with her boyfriend walter for somewhere around 5 or 6 year and they have a child together 3f i met him around age 14 and he started living with u when i turned 15 thing were awkward between u at first but we ve mainly meshed a a unit and on a superficial scale we get along fairly well unfortunately whenever he talk about me or to me he insists on treating himself a if he is a father to me often calling me his daughter or stepdaughter and i just don t see him that way he came into my life when i wa in my mid teen long after i had already been dealing with two neglectful father figure my bio dad who wa not around very often in my formative year and my mother s ex husband who wa emotionally abusive to me by the time i met walter i wa burned out on the whole fatherly experience and wa much happier contending with just my mother a a parental figure a i m very close to her i wasn t hostile but i also didn t care to get to know him or bond with him in addition to this i knew from the start that walter had some kind of drug problem which turned me off to his presence even more when he started living with u my mom suddenly began hiding prescription medicine and other substance in my room a practice she still follows although he s been sober for about 2 or 3 year i am extremely resentful of the fact that we still have to do this even year later and have mentioned that to my mother multiple time there wa a brief time where i started to view him more positively he is great with my little sibling 14f and 13m made some great stride with his sobriety and seemed to really be improving himself i started to believe that perhaps he d become deserving of my trust this lasted about a week and crumbled when he picked me up from college during my junior year he took me to the doctor to refill my prescription i have adhd and take adderall and when the doctor asked who he wa i said for the first time my stepdad that must have made him feel guilty because when we got in the car to leave he finally fessed up and told me that while i wa at school he d found my mother s hiding place for the adderall that she wa going to ship to me and took almost the entire bottle at once when i finally got to it there were 15 of my 60 pill left i thought he wa joking at first and laughed it off until i realized he wa serious and that he had stolen from me a medicine that i needed to get through each day i wa silent for the rest of the car ride and didn t speak to him for about a week after to this day i still haven t forgiven him and i lock all of my pill away in a place he can never get to after this incident my trust in him wa completely shattered and i still don t view him the same way this is why him referring to me a his daughter stepdaughter feel so grating and disrespectful i don t think he s earned that title especially not after what he did to me my mom disagrees and every year on father s day asks me to wish him a happy holiday thank him for being a father to me which i vehemently refuse to do every time it make me uncomfortable that he is essentially taking credit for raising me when the most he s ever done for me not counting monetary contribution to the house a a whole wa driven me when i needed a ride somewhere including taking me to and from college i know that the reason he doe this is due to his disconnect with his own family and that he seek familial bond out with my immediate family because he doesn t have them with his own but it feel unfair that he get to take credit for the work that my mother did my mother is the only parent i ve ever had and the only one i ve ever needed having this man who barely know me insist that he played that role feel so gross and wrong my mom think i m too hard on him and that i need to get over it but i don t think i ever can i want him to stop talking about me with his coworkers and friend a his daughter and to acknowledge that we will never have that kind of connection but i worry that it s been too long since he s been doing it probably since i wa 17 or 18 should i just let it go tl dr my mom s boyfriend that i met in my mid teen keep referring to me a his daughter for a very short time i started to reciprocate that familial feeling but then he betrayed my trust by stealing my prescription medication and i still haven t forgiven him i ve wanted to ask him for year to stop but i feel guilty doing so because of his issue with his own family ha it been too long,0

emotionally abusive relationship i met a guy who wa 17 year older than me when i wa 16 year old on an app yup illegal we didn t meet until i wa 18 year old i had to break off the relationship at 18 because my parent were not supportive and he wa emotionally abusive and manipulative towards me he would occasionally blackmail me and lash out on me calling me name like c slut bitch although we re not in a relationship i would randomly message him for week just to be entertained and to kill time with him when it came time for me to stop talking to him he would repeat the cycle of blackmailing and calling me name honestly i know it s my fault for talking to him again but every time i talk with him he s the same person over again now 21 we originally agreed to meet in november so he booked a hotel room for 500 although i suggested the meet up he followed through with it i even told him to send me his itinerary to make sure he wa gonna do it 2 day before we met i said that this would be the last time i d see him he said he misunderstood and didn t think it wa going to be the last time he d see me he then said he d cancel it and proceeded to call me a selfless b 1 month later he hit me up and say i owe him money for that and for making excuse not to see him anymore i told him that i didn t owe him anything and that it wa his decision to ultimately decide to meet with me he then blackmail me and say that he will send a letter to my parent and tell them that i ve been talking to him behind their back he then said my phone is hacked so if your video and photo are leaked it s not my fault i wa honestly so fed up and had the gut to go to the police station to report him i could have reported him for talking to a minor but i reported him for harassment and blackmailing i showed the police officer the current convo i had with him and she said for me to tell him that i reported him to the police station i unfortunately don t have any screenshots of the past convos i ve had with him if i had that evidence i would have showed the police officer those message thankfully i still have his voice mail the voicemail were of him threatening me and calling me name looking back at it i realized all of the sign of emotional abuse the police officer got his contact info and said she will look him up the police officer said i don t owe him anything and that he s being an a the only way he could request the money would be by going through in civil court but he most likely wouldn t win yeah there wa a mutual agreement to meet but also part of me felt like it wa a bad decision i feel like anyone can change their mind it wa his decision to book a hotel it wa my decision to not see him anymore due to a bad feeling it honestly surprise me that a 38 year old is blackmailing me and requesting money from a 21 year old also i had to lend him 300 in the past and he paid me back of all people he knew he asked me for the money i feel like i m more mature than him which is crazy this felt like a victory i felt like i escaped from an emotionally abusive person who felt like he had full control of me i ve always mentioned that i would report on him but i never followed through with it because of how scared i wa he took advantage of my kindness and saw me a weak my friend came with me to the police station and i felt like i wa in the right for reporting this person part of me is scared that he will try to do something to me but i know that the police know who this man is also part of me regret being in this situation but then again there s a first for everything he blackmailed me and harassed me for 5 year is it normal to feel this way,1

my m35 bf of over a year gave me f28 an ultimatum and it s a really tough decision throwaway because my so us reddit basic gist of the story is that i have always been very clear from day one that i did not want child i have never seen a child in my future and because of a relatively terrible childhood i have a lot of fear surrounding parenting when we first began dating it seemed like he wa on the same page but he s older than i am and it seems he s changed his mind and really want a kid so he more or le proposed to me saying he wanted to take the next step together move in get married and have a child he ha already been married once so the fact that he even ha gotten to this point and want this with me should be flattering i love him and i know that he could provide me and a future child with a much better life then i ve ever had he told me he would make whatever concession i wanted nanny s daycare etc along with saying that he would support me if i wanted to start my own business i m now heading towards thirty and don t feel a rigid about kid a i used to tho the idea still fill me with an all consuming terror if i say yes what if i regret it and feel resentful towards him and this potential child if i say no i ll lose him and if i decide in the future to have child i doubt it will be under these type of condition raising kid is expensive and i grew up broke and constantly afraid so if i do decide to have kid in a few year i may have missed out on giving them a truly great life tldr boyfriend want to get married and have a child i have always been ambivalent about kid but he s offering me a lot of support and security i love him and i don t want u to grow to resent each other but i also don t want to regret losing out on a potentially wonderful life together,0

i 20f am sleeping with my former teacher 50m how this relationship came to be is quite the long winded tale so i m going to exclude most of the detail for both the sake of both brevity and anonymity a few month ago i started sleeping with a former high school teacher of mine this wa over a year after i graduated and i initiated contact between the two of u although he wa my teacher there wa no relationship between u during school other than the typical student teacher relationship so grooming shouldn t be considered here long story short we both developed feeling for one another we re still in contact now and though we won t be dating for obvious reason we still plan on seeing each other when i m back in town at this point we re pretty close friend who feel comfortable talking to one another about our dating life but the chemistry between u is still there so there are some expectation for the next time i see him i ve had people tell me he s a creep for allowing this to happen but i ve also had a moderate amount of support since the people around me can tell he make me happy i don t really see an issue with the relationship we have a we re two adult i do of course understand that there may be some negative moral implication on his behalf before i see him again i want to get some outsider perspective especially from older redditors am i blinded by naivete or considering the consensual circumstance might this be seen a okay tl dr is a 30 year age gap inherently bad if i don t feel there s been any abuse of power,0

therapist doesn t want to be talking about my abuse and focus too much on my childhood possible tws hello everyone i 24m am barely out of a 10 year long physically and emotionally abusive relationship with my ex 24f we broke up about two month ago but i moved out of the appartment we were living in together just 2 week ago i ve got into therapy with a trauma specialized therapist and we ve had about 5 session together we re still in the diagnosis process so i haven t seen any progress yet but at first it felt good to be talking of that to someone however during the second session the discussion drifted from my abusive relationship to my childhood and we haven t really talked about the abuse ever since aside from mentioning it worse yet she said to me multiple time something along the line of you were in a relationship you said wa abusive or toxic which felt very much like she wa doubting the abuse i ve experienced but i might just be sensitive i know that my childhood which i have a very poor memory of could explain at least in part why i got in an abusive relationship and why i am so disconnected from my emotion and need right now but it feel like we shouldn t be talking about that right now or at the very least it shouldn t be the center of the attention right now am i just being sensitive is there something i don t get in the therapeutic process which could explain why we re not talking of my trauma right now should i find an other therapist and lose 5 week of therapy thanks,1

people who have moved on from abusive relationship is it normal for it to be this hard bear with me because this is long i 35f met a guy online a year ago and we were together for 7 month my last two relationship before before him were abusive but i had 4 year on my own wa pretty happily single all in all anyway i figured i wa ready to meet people again and wanted a boyfriend and after online dating for a little while we hit it off because rape wa a part of one of those abusive relationship i would have panic attack during sex quite often this forced me to disclose to him what had happened and he suggested i go to therapy which i did and that ha been helpful anyway over summer we went on a holiday together and he wa really critical about a few thing i did and i saw this a a sign of thing to come panicked and broke thing off looking back i had no idea going in how bad my trust issue with men really were but this behaviour say a lot this and a few other thing made me realise how anxious i wa during our whole relationship we were back in touch a friend and i apologised to him because i hadn t understood or managed my anxiety in any meaningful way or helped him understand it either i thought that a long a we were trucking along and hitting milestone like going away together i would just learn to trust him and the anxiety would just go away well spoiler alert we never talked about it so it didn t in fact it got worse recently we were back in touch and talked about getting back together we talked about sex he ha a bdsm fetish and thought i would always struggle to explore that with him because of my past i wa really honest and said i would be open to trying the bdsm stuff i read up on it when he said he wa into it and get how important consent is in that community but instead of rushing headlong into thing a we had done what i need is to slow it right down focus on my pleasure build trust and intimacy slowly he said he didn t have the patience to go slow god that really hurt and we called it quits i feel so defeated and alone i worry that i m asking for too much and no one will have the patience i m asking for and that i ll never be able to even try and build trust with a man i ve wanted to be in a partnership with someone for so long and it felt like we were so close but just not close enough starting again with a new person feel like climbing a mountain i mean how can i even start asking for this from anyone i just met would love to hear from anyone who ha successfully moved on from this shit i just really need some hope right now doe it get easier thanks for reading this far,1
me 27f about to end 9 year relationship with fiance 31m am i making a mistake so i ve had these faltering feeling for my fiance for a while now i just don t think i m in love with my fiance anymore to the point where spending time with him feel like an obligation and not something i want to do i also just tend to go solo on thing in term of going out with friend and whatnot which i don t think is a normal thing to do all the time he s done nothing wrong nothing to warrant this and ha been kind and caring i feel awful for it but unfortunately no matter how much i try the feeling just aren t there anymore i think it s got a lot to do with he is my first and only real relationship and i started dating him when i wa fairly young 17 two week from turning 18 and since then i ve changed a lot a a person yet i feel so guilty because nothing really caused this change in feeling it s something i ve been struggling with and in denial about for a few year yet it feel so weird to throw away something that s lasted 9 year but ultimately being stuck like this is making me depressed there seems to be no winning here i told him of my feeling back in october but he convinced me to try therapy with him to see if that could help thing however neither of u have really put forth any effort on thing the therapist ha told u to try work out so that s taking u no where i m thinking of talking to him about ending thing today when he get home from work but there s still something holding me back i think i m terrified that i m making some huge mistake despite my feeling telling me otherwise i also hate that this is going to hurt him i may not be in love with him anymore but i don t hate him i wish i could make this process easier for him i don t want to ruin future relationship for him and want to see him back on his foot a quickly a possible the other thing is i m losing everything by doing this my apartment my cat probably some friend a lot of shared item and i even got super attached to his family basically anything that s currently normal in my life is going to change and it make me and anxious and overwhelmed mess the main reason i am not taking the cat despite loving them dearly is i don t want to break his heart further by also taking something else he love y know i m trying to be a kind a possible even if it end up hurting me is this normal doe it sound like i m making the right choice i feel like a villain here simply because nothing warranted this it just kind of happened however i can t think of anything that will bring these feeling back amp x200b tl dr been struggling with feeling for a few year with fiance of 9 year tried therapy with no luck thinking of ending thing tonight but i m scared i m making a huge mistake am i making the right choice or should i try harder,0

i 28f opened up to my boyfriend m30 about my promiscuous past and i think it made him very uncomfortable i ve been dating my current boyfriend for about 7 month now and everything wa going great up until i revealed to him my sexual past when i wa around 18 19 year old and a freshman in college i slept around quite a bit it s not something i m super proud of because i wasn t doing it for the enjoyment of sex i wa very insecure and wish i had loved and respected myself more i wish i hadn t given myself up so easily to guy who objectified me but it is what it is to put it into more context a lot of the guy i slept with are in a specific fraternity the same one my boyfriend happens to be apart of he s still fairly involved to this day anyway the conversation came up a few day ago when he told me there wa an event this weekend he wanted to take me to one where many guy in his fraternity would be he knew that i had a high body count but didn t know the specific he made a joke looking back maybe it wa a honest inquiry disguised a a joke saying something like it would be funny if you had sex with people i know haha he could tell by my reaction i guess that i had in fact slept with people he probably knew or knew of he asked well did you i wanted to put it all out there since i d be going with him to the event so i said yes he went to a different college in a different state than me so the likelihood in my mind that he wa well acquainted with any of those guy didn t seem like a huge possibility he didn t ask for specific name or anything and when i asked him if it bothered him at all he said no well fast forward to this past friday when we were supposed to make the drive to the event for the weekend he told me he didn t want to take me anymore i asked him if it wa because of what i told him and he said honestly a little bit yes we ll talk about it when i get back it s sunday now and he ll be back in town later this evening we ve been texting all weekend and he called me last night and everything seemed fine i think but now i m concerned that my past ha come back to haunt me and may possibly end the relationship i didn t think it wa a big deal all of this happened so long ago and i m no longer the same insecure promiscuous girl all of those guy are either in relationship or married with child themselves so why would it matter now i can t help but imagine him sitting around a table showing his boy my picture and getting laughed out of the room or something i don t know should i be concerned that this may end our relationship i can t imagine u breaking up and my friend and family asking me why and me having to explain he found out i had sex with a bunch of guy he know and couldn t take it or something tl dr i revealed my sexual past to my boyfriend of 7 month it turn out some of the guy are in his fraternity guy that he probably know and thing feel really awkward now,0
i went back to my abusive ex i feel like an idiot for doing it i shouldn t have done it after a few month of having someone the reality of having no one scared me too much he came to me apologizing and promising to be better telling me how much he loved me how stupid he wa how he want to get better and be better for himself and for me it didn t last long didn t last a full month before it reverted to the same shtick all the gaslighting and provocation drive you mad he would put me down put himself above me he would decide i wa being too crazy if i ever tried communicating my feeling too emotional or any of that i couldn t expect someone who care or is willing to listen to me he get to decide when im stepping out of line randomly the line always change and then get mad at me for being a bitch he d get me so shaken and upset i d say horrible thing because i wanted him to hurt even a little a much a he hurt me and then he d tell me i m the abusive one it could be a mundane thing that he d insist i wa blowing out of proportion and instigate a fight while saying i wa the one instigating a fight and then it quickly became you re too hard to love i m leaving you and i wa so scared of being alone i d beg him to stay shaking and cry one time i had a bad day at work and wanted to conplain when i said i couldn t take his advice of just find a new job it quickly became an hour long fight turning into him telling me how i am unlovable he isolated me he d break my stuff he got to decide everything i hate him i hate myself i can t keep opening myself up to people but the crushing loneliness propels a cycle i want to be better but i don t think i can be ive struggled with interpersonal relationship ever since i wa in grade school,1
